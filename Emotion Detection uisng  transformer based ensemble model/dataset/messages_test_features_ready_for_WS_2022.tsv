I wish that I could help others more when I learn about a problem. When others are suffering I like to be able to help them get over it. I like to be known as a good friend to others who are in need. I have had situations in my life that I wish I had someone to turn to and I did not. That is the person I try to be for my friends. I like to understand why people do the things they do and make the choices they make. I think that the story could have turned out different if they had the help or input from others.	1	6	3	33	63000	4.167	1	joy	7	7	5.5	6	7	3.714	1	1.714	4.143

Things like this happened previously at a very alarming rate and continue to happen today even if it is less frequent. The problem with bringing these issues forward at a later date is that it is hard for these claims to be validated with so much time in between the actual act. I think the rhetoric and climate of current administration in the white house also helps add to the power of these men to just deny the claims.	1	6	3	30	55000	4.167	4	neutral	5.5	6	6	5.5	5.5	3.143	3.286	3.143	3.143

My grandfather was a Vietnam War veteran and he would wake in the middle of night screaming three or four days out of the week. PTSD and anxiety that stems from being overseas at war is something that should be taken very serious when it comes to Veterans who have issues later in life. Not getting enough sleep at night can also cause a whole new host of health issues.	1	6	3	30	55000	4	5	anger	5.5	6	6	5.5	5.5	3.143	3.286	3.143	3.143

There is so many things wrong with the American system of adopting children from other countries.  If we are going to adopt children from other countries as Americans, they should be granted their citizenship immediately upon being adopted. Before another adoption takes place that involves American parents, and innocent children from another country, there needs to be new rules, regulations, and laws mandated for the protection of these children and families of what can be deemed as a sloppy American adoption system.
