it is really diheartening to read about these immigrants from this article who drowned.  it makes me feel anxious and upset how the whole ordeal happened.  it is a terrible occurrence that this had to happen at the mediterranean sea.  thankfully there were some survivors.  the fact that babies were lost makes it that much more emotional to read all of this,sadness
the phone lines from the suicide prevention line surged after the election.  it also climbed when robin williams committed suciide.  thankfully there is this prevention line to help those in need who have sucidal thoughts but we need to condition people that committing sucide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,sadness
"no matter what your heritage, you should be able to serve your country.  her thai heritage shouldn't preclude her and shouldn't have been an issue in this debate.  tammy duckworth and her family should be congratulated on the services they have provided to this country.  any type of racism should not be allowed in a debate",neutral
it is frightening to learn about all these shark attacks but these surfers should be aware of the risks associated with the sport.  relocating the sharks should be a priority and it would be in the best interest to establish a moratorium on water sports until the shark epidemic is dealt with.  closing beach in australia is a good precautionary method,fear
"the eldest generation of russians aren't being treated properly and should have some sort of financial compensation.  they are living off very little per day financially and live in poor conditions.  after paying utilities, they barely have enough for food.  health care has also taken a turn for the worse because they can't afford to get proper health treatment due to the costs involved",sadness
"middle east is fucked up, I've honestly never heard of a middle east country such as Afganistan deporting people, the mention of it just sound funny, who the heck would want to stay in that shit hole country that has been infested with terrorists and child rapists? Perhaps those refugees are out of choice, honestly they should come to a better country such as U.S. or U.K, even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration, but I think they're quite tolerate to people from war torn countries",anger
"well first of all whoever wrote this article doesn't know how to properly divide an article into paragraphs, which made reading this article extremely painful, but nonetheless I do know after reading the article that Zika virus tend to stay in semen and vaginal fluid for extended amount of time, so it's obvious don't mate with people who have zika virus, and don't even think about having a baby, they're going to be defective",anger
"well well well, look at what we have well, the arrogant Kim Kardashian finally got what she deserves: being robbed for millions, the thought of it is bitter, considering it's a robbery after all, but think the other way, a rich superfluous gal as Kim, broadcasting her belongings on social media, I guess she brought this upon herself",disgust
"just another fucked up mental sickness of american police against its black residents, I honestly have no idea why they have to be so sensitive with their fucking guns, they shoot people as if people can respawn after being shot or something, police should think twice before taking out people's lives with no legitimate reason, I guess it's good that police have body cam, so the public can see what shame they are brining upon themselves",anger
"it seems a horny male college student has finally taken up the courage not to pursue love, but to rape his potential lover, what a disgusting act and moral corruption, the amount of emotional trauma done to the female victim is permanent and she would never feel safe again, I hope he gets to sentence to jail long enough he thought through",disgust
I thought the article was quite sad to read and disheartening to hear about the Iraqi people. I felt sad for them knowing their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a job. The economy they deal with is much worse than ours and I can only imagine how difficult it must be living there. I hope that it gets better in the future.,sadness
I'm sorry to hear that about Dakota's parents. Even when you are adult it must be hard to see your parents splitting up. No one wants that to happen and it's unfortunate that her parents couldn't work it out. I hope they are able to still remain civil around the kids and family. Just because it didn't work romantically doesn't mean it won't work at all.,sadness
Hearing about the violence going on over politics in the country is really sad and upsetting. It's easy to take for granted how we live and how lucky we are that we don't have to worry about people killing us on a daily basis. Our government is also democratic which means people have a voice. This isn't the case in some areas/,sadness
"I think almost everyone has an opinion on Hilary Clinton over Donald Trump. Many didn't expect Donald to win the election but here we are. So many political scandals unfolded and more continuing to unravel. Many didn't agree with Hilary from the Bengazi investigation and many didn't agree with Trump, but in the end that's just politics.",neutral
"It's so sad to see that world hunger is still such a large issue in other countries, especially when it seems like so much of our food goes to waste. Children passing out in the streets simply because they have no food to eat is heartbreaking. No one should have to suffer simply because they can't afford food. There needs to be another option.",sadness
"It's really amazing to me how much food we waste as a country considering how overweight and obese people are. I can't believe how wasteful it all is, if you think about it. A lot of the food we eat, we don't need, and then we throw away so much too! All that food belongs with people who really need it. I wish people would donate more and that restaurants could donate their unused food to homeless shelters.",surprise
"This is a crazy story with so many facets to it, omg. I mean on one hand, I don't support an eye for an eye. I don't support the death penalty and I don't support blinding someone. BUT on the other hand, this is a country where women really struggle and the justice system is not well developed. ALSO, he blinded a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL. What the fuck is wrong with this guy. So if this was in America I would not support it, but I don't feel right condemning the actions of an entirely different country for doing what they felt needed to be done.",anger
I've heard of necrotizing fasciitis before. It's really fucking scary to think that just from a tiny little cut you could get a disease that has a high likelihood of killing you. There's also a similar bacteria called naegleria fowlerii that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain. Nature is fucking metal.,disgust
I totally support these protesters. We've had trouble with oil pipelines here in Michigan. I feel like these pipelines are foisted on local communities without any care for whether it is good for the community and without adequate studies as to how safe they are from leaks and pollution. There are more important things in life than money and oil.,disgust
"I'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this. At first I was perturbed at the first article because I felt like the lady was being ridiculous. She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(",surprise
It's too bad that we are still in the middle east.  I wish Trump would just pull out of the middle east entirely so our soldiers will stop being targets for all the countries that hate us.  The longer we are there the easier we make it for them to inflict damage to our troops.  It must not be easy for them to be there away from their families.,joy
It's a shame that air pollution has potentially been linked to increased mental damage with young children.  We often don't take into account all the damage that the fossil fuel companies have done to our society.  We only praise them for creating the fuels we use but never tax them appropriately for all the damage that they cause us.,anger
It's a shame how troubled the middle east is and has been for the longest time.  I wish we could come to some agreement with the rest of the world on how to realistically handle the multiple situations in the middle east.  I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.,sadness
"It's a shame that we have so many random acts of violence in this country.  It seems every other week we have some massacre involving either guns, a right wing extremist or a muslim extremist.  I think what they have in common are either mentally ill people or people who are extremist in their world views and religion.",disgust
This is just one of the negative consequences of long term war in a region.  The hospitals in Yemen have been devastated by war and no diseases are starting to spread among the population with no way to control them without outside help.  I hope the people of Yemen will be able to find humanitarian aid soon to help them control the spread of disease.,sadness
"If you are using trumps name to make him look bad is not the answer here. I know that trump is not being a good president right now but lets not discredit his success. Somebody burned a church that is not related to Donald Trump at all, lots of Families go to that church. I think someone used this attack as an attack to Donald Trump because he is not affiliated with this and makes people look like he caused this",disgust
"I felt sad that the turtles are fading because of the habitat temperature rising annually. We, as humans can help I think by trying to not contribute to the increase of Carbon Dioxide consumption, we can stop global warming and try to help t he sea turtles from going extinct and so our children and grandchildren can see them in the future.",sadness
This shooting is a good example of how black people and people w are wrongly prosecuted by the police. Now in this articles this gentlemen is getting a re-trial since they concur that he didn't do such thing and basically had the police lying to the judge. Now he can be fairly be judged and not be discriminated,disgust
"Felt bad reading the article because tons of people are losing basically their lives. The wild fires are destroying their farm, things, and even their animals. Without all of those things they cant have a proper living through buying and selling crops or animals. I hope we can donate to an organization nor something to help them",sadness
"I feel for her. They couldn’t afford to cremate them on their own and help them, and the financial help they were entitled to as crime victims had not come through because the system today isn't going to help criminals. I hope the government now helps criminals through dangerous activities and make the world a better place",sadness
"I wish there was something more that I could do. This is getting out of hand, but it's kind of far away geographically from us. There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.",joy
"Climate change is extremely worrisome. And it is getting worse and worse every year. Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.",fear
It's shocking how little people care about this and how little Africa gets mentioned in the news. This is horrific when you think about the number of victims and the people who are harmed. I wish people could focus on this. It's ridiculous that people are getting away with this and it is a huge crisis on the level of other genocides in history.,surprise
I hope everyone is ok. I was in a small earthquake and it was extremely scary. A lot of people can die if you don't have safe buildings. I think there should be a major international effort to provide guidance for any nations in an earthquake prone region so that we can do a little bit to prevent more deaths when the earthquakes inevitably hit.,fear
"This doesn't sound too worrisome to me. If you are affected by depression, then you should decide as an individual to find another option. It's just a side effect, I think there are many medicines out there that have depression as a side effect. It is something that individuals should be aware of, but nothing critical.",neutral
"Here's an article about crazed person who murdered two unfortunate women overseas. Life is crazy. I can't imagine what the families are going through. Having to go to or being forced into sex work is bad enough, but for it to end like this is just sad. It feels like there's no place safe in this world to be a woman sometimes.",sadness
"Some people are just disturbed. Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.",fear
"Every time I hear something about ISIS, I can't help but think about the role the US played in its creation and the horrors that have come from the vacuum of power in the region. I'm thankful to be American when I read something like this, but also ashamed at the same time in who we've chosen to represent us, not just now, but over the past 30 years.",sadness
"You know I'm not a fan of religion in any context, but this type of thing happens everywhere. There's always some idiot who goes off and uses religion, bigotry, sex, gender, anything really as an explanation. It's sad that you read something like this and it doesn't even feel like news. Perhaps its just our access that's making this seem ordinary.",sadness
Reading stuff like this puts the refugee in perspective. There has to be something the international community can do that isn't taking in refugees permanently. The vast majority of these people just want to live and build something for themselves. It is of no fault of their own that they were unfortunate enough to be born within the fist of a crazed dictator.,sadness
"Hello, I thought this behavior was a thing of the past, but read this article, it is rather enlightening. I often think here in the US there is a great divide on how racial issues are dealt with, and the US is not the only one. There are many racial problems in other countries and that makes me feel hopeless for the future. If we can't fix the issues here in America, how can we critizice other countries?",surprise
"The fact that human beings are abusing the planet and each other is evident in this article. It is enough to get you depressed, read this so you can get an idea of how pollution affects third wolrd countries. Instead of going after industries (probably all American) with fines, they rather close schools because of the pollution and smog. Their health is being affected and not only that, the enviroment is being completely abused.",sadness
"How sad, if you get a chance read this and maybe share, it could be the difference for this person to find her family! Sometimes I see these announcements and I usually read and share them, I hope they find who she is and most importanly I hope they find her family and get her some help. I think the more people see, read and share this info, the bigger the chance to find her identity and family, imagine if it was someone you knew.",sadness
"I know this article is super wordy, but it is an interesting read, if you have a chance ad you are bored, make sure you read it. It is about how Democrats will move forward in the next few years to get legoslation moving. It has been hard with Trump in the White House for the whole country, but imagine being a democrat right now trying to push legislation that your constituents are asking about? What a time to be alive! We should all just try to make the country a lot better right now!",joy
"Reading about issues happening across the world seems foreign, but just think: any trouble anywhere in the world, the US is usually involved. I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.",sadness
"How disgusting is Wells Fargo? It's unbelievable the way they treated their tellers, and all those fake accounts? Can you even? I don't understand how this bank doesn't get shut down. You really should think about getting an account with a different bank, you know. What if your SS got used to make some of those accounts?",anger
"Oh, but global warming isn't real, right? We have all kinds of time to fix the problem, right? It's not humans, it's natural variation, right? Holy crap are we ever ostriches as a species - are we going to dig our heads out of the sand in time? Change has to happen, and it has to happen now, we can't wait for all the old white men who run things to die",anger
"That's incredibly disgusting. I feel like it should count as a hate crime, and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that incident should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their involvement. I really hope the LGBT community organizes some kind of boycott; Royal Caribbean should be made to feel financial pain for their negligence",disgust
"You know how you were having trouble sleeping? Here, read about people who have tinnitus - it'll put you to sleep. I feel like more should be done to help the seven percent who say their tinnitus is a big problem for them, though. That's the same as any other psychiatric complaint, right? If it's affecting your life so that you can't function normally, there should be some kind of help for you",neutral
"This is terrible, but what I find hard to believe is that there are still that many Yahoo accounts in the world that aren't spambots. Or some other kind of bots. Anyway, aren't you glad I got you on gmail? I'm glad I shut my yahoo account down a long time ago. You should probably do that, if you haven't, just for safety's sake.",anger
"I just read an article about America's refugee problem, that talked about the Somali community in Minneapolis. I can't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article; it just makes me sick to see any reporting that doesn't only concern the facts, with no editorializing by the author. I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.",sadness
"I just read an article about some chowder-head who used a hammer and a pick ax to destroy Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Wow, what a great protest. You sure showed him. Good job.  Lol, can you believe this garbage? Who has such a hollow and pathetic life that they don't have anything better to do with their time than commit petty vandalism because they dislike some politician? What a dingus.",anger
"So, I had to read an article about somebody named Kylie Jenner, and evidently she has some sort of makeup line or something. Anyway, evidently she must be popular for some reason, because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand. She put out some message about how you should only buy direct from her website. I guess a sucker is born every minute.",neutral
"I read an article about Typhoon Meranti. The article said the storm passed by Taiwan without actually hitting the island, which I suppose was a good thing, because evidently there was another storm in 2009, Typhone Morakot, that killed a bunch of people and did billions of dollars of damage. I'm glad I don't live somewhere where there's any inclement weather like that, it must be miserable to live on an island where it's hot and crowded.",neutral
"I read about this asshole Arcan Cetin who shot up a mall in Oak Harbor, Washington. Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.",disgust
"I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.",sadness
"I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate.",surprise
"Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.",anger
"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state.",anger
"Apparently there are now a lot of wildfires in the Appalachia area, and it seems people are going to try to spin this into a ""climate change"" story. It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true. Why has a vast swath of temperature readings been ""corrected""? Most people don't even know about this issue.",sadness
"Funny how it always comes down the to the gun and not the person wielding it. People will always be able to get guns, legally or not. the issue is more with society treatment of young men. Too many single moms, too many kids being ostracized and bullied. But yeah, that's the gun's fault. i don't own a gun, but I'd be damned if I gave one up to those liberal fascists.",disgust
"This is what happens when you take in people from an archaic civilization.  All of these refugees need to be throw back into their mud pit. Their religion embraces hatred. Let them figure out how to live in peace in their own countries, then we can allow them into civilized world. Is it is now, I think all of Europe is doomed.",sadness
"This seems like a conspiracy reach, but the medical exams were either lying or the bodies were really never examined. The Poles have a reason to distrust Russia- Russia does itself no favors, no country in the World should trust them-, they have a long history of conflict. The reason we had Polish jokes in America a few decades ago started with Russian racism towards Poles.",anger
"you can't sleep too much or too little. What else is new. I'm sure there will be a high priced drug that can solve this issue. The scientists and government of America couldn't care less about the average citizen. Look at the food supply, look at all of the drugs they want us to take. it's all about money and has nothing to do with concern for our well-being.",anger
"Again it's all about the money. Corporate America strikes again. They leech as much money from the working class as possible as they sit in their office, finger banging their secretary. When their lies and misdirection is revealed, some fat cat takes the blame (along with millions of dollars of hush money, and the working class is thrown to the wolves and blamed for most of the misdeeds.",anger
"This story about the shooting at the airport is absolutely breaking my heart.  There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.",anger
"Did you know that the spread of cholera is so terrible?  I had no idea this was still such a daunting issue so many people face.  I agree with a line in the article that said ""The idea that people are still dying in 2015 of cholera is outrageous.”  I feel so heartbroken that people are dying simply because they don't have clean water and appropriate medical care.",sadness
Can you believe what this family has done to these girls?  They have treated these children so heinously.  It is insane that the police wouldn't do anything until they were basically forced by the media.  I can appreciate things that happened later to help these girls but this so unfair.  This breaks my heart.,sadness
Are you aware that only certain refuges are helped and accepted?  I can't imagine the heart break that they endure traveling so far thinking they are safe to be turned around and denied.  The whole system is so flawed.  There is no appropriate help for these people!  They have so many unfair hurdles to go through.,sadness
"Poor woman!  I hope that she is able to recover.  I hate to hear of anyone being in an accident.  I see that there were three cars involved.  I wonder if she was the other one critically injured.  I guess if there were were at least three people involved and only one was seriously injured, those aren't the worst odds.",sadness
"So apparently sea ice is becoming less and less which is a concern four our environment and all I can think of is how it will affect the animals in the ocean.  This cannot be good for the ecosystem.  Or is it? In contrast to the article, i remember seeing a whale die because the ice was so thick and they were trapped. Perhaps neither are good, but how do we fix this?",sadness
"So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.",sadness
This article was so sad.  I guess ISIS had killed many people recently in israel.  They were very rude about it and many people were at high tension worried they had bombs or traps set up as they were recovering and looking for more bodies.   They said the people of ISIS just dumped there bodies as if they were trash.,sadness
"So today i read about Vaughn, an actor I didn't really know his name but have watched or heard most of the shows and movies he has been in.  Today, i heard, he died at age 83 due to lukemia.  IT is very sad to lose such a well respected actor.  I guess his parents divorced at a young age but both gave him the genes to act.",sadness
"This is so sad.  Today I read about a lady who passed away November 6th and had shared many of her stories of her experiences in the holocaust.  IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.",sadness
"The first article never appeared, there was only a generic place holders and nothing to write about. I answered questions about my emotions based on how I feel right now and I'm writing this to explain that the article wasn't there. I hope that the following articles will appear and I'll be able to finish this survey as intended.",neutral
"It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.",joy
After reading this story I think the right decision was made. It seems to me that the man had no reason to shoot at those kids just because they were playing loud music. Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.,neutral
It's such a shame that so much violence takes place over there each year. You'd think all the different factions would finally agree to disagree and move on but instead they just seem to want to keep killing. I understand why since so many different groups want to destroy the other side leaving smaller nations like Yemen to have to defend themselves since the other factions seem to be unable to leave in peace.,sadness
Overall the problem here seems to be that overuse of resources in a certain area needs to be stopped. Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into. There should also be some sort of testing and filtering system put into place to protect the people.,anger
"I can't imagine what it must have been like for the people who were caught up in this, how helpless they must have felt. Not having any recourse for so long, no one doing anything to right the wrongs, just feeling like it's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so long and happen to so many people. Maybe they feel some kind of closure now though.",sadness
"Reading this was infuriating to me. To see such casual disregard for life, both of the animals and those protecting them, in pursuit of money. And for what? Snake oil cures in Asia, superstitious nonsense, and rich people wanting to feel powerful. The security teams seem like they're in an impossible position, restrained by rules while their opponents have none. It's a miserable situation",anger
"It may make me sound horrible, but I'm torn on this. No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating. If it was a child, however, this is insanity and just horrifying.",sadness
"It was sort of sadly ironic to see the part in there about ""we don't think he'll win"" considering what followed. All of it, sadly, still rings true, day after day. There's been no apology, only a doubling down on the kind of bile, arrogance, and ignorance that was on display since day one. I feel bad for every woman in the country who has to live with someone like that as their president.",sadness
"This is horrifying. You're just going about your business, then someone takes issue with you, and suddenly you're dead. Maybe you didn't even interact with them and they just decided to kill you for fun. It's deeply troubling and makes you suspicious of every stranger on the street. I also feel bad for those who had to witness this and didn't have time to do anything to stop it. I'd imagine some feel guilty even though they couldn't have helped.",fear
"I have pretty strong thoughts and feelings about this. From what I read, I feel like that is a very tragic situation. Us as a society, we are taking advantage of the trees we have here. In order to protect the environment and make the environment better again, we need to take care of it. What we are doing, in my opinion, is morally and ethnically wrong and we need to do a better job of taking care of nature. I understand that some blame is from the volcanoes of hawaii, but feel like us humans do way more damage than what mother nature brings.",disgust
"This article greatly disturbs me. The fact that we treat Muslims and people of their culture like dogs and terrorist is disgusting and wrong both morally and ethically. The way they are being shown on tv and media is wrong and horrible. Our president thinks that if we ban muslims from the country, all of a sudden our nation is safe. When the fact of the matter is, most shootings that happen in this country, are from Caucasians. Muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment.",disgust
"This article is just awful. Boko Haram is an extremist group that needs to be stopped by any means necessary. The fact of the matter is these people are using religion as an excuse to rape and kill woman and children, and thats one of the most unmoral and unethical things I can think of. These poor women and children are not only kidnapped and drugged, but they are also dealing with being raped and having their loved ones killed. This is an awful and tragic issue, and this is something that needs to be shown throughout the entire world that these people are bad and need to be stopped.",disgust
"To be honest with you, In my opinion, I do not believe Russia or Syria are peaceful countries. Syria has the most corrupt and dishonest government officials in the world, and the fact that Russia has defended them through everything is very disturbing and alarming. I know we all like to think that Trump and Putin are in ""bed"" together, but is that really the case? What Syria does to its own people goes beyond what words can describe, and how Russia can defend these actions is almost as equally disgusting.",disgust
"Awful news article. Us as a society need to do a better job of protecting and helping not only our planet, but the animals and mammals that surround it. The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.",fear

Poor bird had to be euthanized because of its injuries! The bird was 19 years old!

Soooo SAD!",disgust

It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life.

My heart breaks for this people, as they don't have anyone to turn to for help. They feel powerless, hungry and scared.",sadness
"I don't necessarily agree with this stance, as I feel Trump can help our country move forth and improve economically. While Trump wasn't my ideal President, he was the much better choice over Clinton. So, in my opinion, he was the better candidate. I feel like Obama was a joke as a President, and what did he really do during his 8 years of Presidency that he will be remembered for? ObamaCare? That isn't a positive in my opinion.

There are many police officers that believe they are above the law, and the common citizens doesn't have any rights when they are interacting with them. Unfortunately, it's very sad to say, that even if a citizen is innocent, if they don't cooperate to the fullest, the police can physically harm them, even possibly lead to being shot and killed. This is very scary! So, while I don't believe all officers are like this, one is too many!",sadness
There was a terrible bus crash near the town where I grew up.  It looks like a black sedan hit the bus and people were hurt.  Apparently the injured people were taken to a nearby hospital where I used to work.

Please say a prayer for all involved and be grateful that no lives were lost.,sadness
I am so bothered and upset about the elementary school teacher that was charged with child pornography.  I cannot believe a trusted individual would commit such a heinous crime involving children!

I really feel for those parents of the children involved and hope that it does not do permanent damage to all those sweet babies!,anger
I don't know much about cricket but apparently in England it's a very big deal!  This one town's team is under the gun to win the championship and needs only 33 more points to pull it off.

I wonder if they have as big of a fan base as most of our sports do here in the states?,surprise
Ugh have you seen what's going on in New Delhi?  The air pollution over there is horrible and so many people are getting seriously sick!  They are calling the city a gas chamber because the air quality is so bad.

I can't imagine how helpless parents feel when there's nothing they can do to help their kids.,sadness

"Wow. So... I sure as fuck do not have that much to say about that stupid article / news story. But, I guess that I'll try to think of something. It's also not at all something that I would share or want to share with anyone that I know. It's not relevant to me or the people that I know and care about. It's not something that I would just choose to read either. Ok. Have you seen this article about the dad that killed his daughter's molester? Apparently she was molested when she was young, the guy went to jail for a year and a half and was let out. Many years later, the dad went and shot the guy. That's pretty much it.

I am really saddened by what is happening in Brazil. I can't stand that this type of damage is happening in nature.

I think this situation will more or less quickly be resolved. It is just a temporary issue and I really believe the gas prices will go back to normal.

I am at shock for what I have just read. First of all I would need a lot of time to reflect on what just transpired in the article I read. Please when you read this try not to get too sad about it because it will get you sad.

I'm just in shock at what I read. All these migrants attempting to make a better life for themselves ironically met an untimely and unexpected end.

There have been over 200 attacks since election day can you imagine that? I hate that trunp supporters somehow feel vindicated with their awful racism.,anger
I feel like our police force is getting kinda out of control with its killings recently. It's all i seem to hear about on the news nowadays. They recently charged an officer who shot an unarmed black driver when he was outside his vehicle.It's like the police don't even care anymore which is really scary.,fear

I can't believe just how much manipulation went on behind the scenes of Donald Trumps campaign. I feel like we will never know the true extend of how corrupt his whole deal was. First you hear about all these huge collections of data and then you get the idots who defend him about climate change being fake.,anger
I really think everyone should read this article. This story shows perfectly how damaging and dangerous guns can be to all people on both sides of the law.

I know some people will say it is not a person, but this is still another needless murder that occurred because of a gun.",sadness

It's not surprising that Wells Fargo was opening fake accounts. Imagine the headache of having to deal with that on your credit report. Those customers should be compensated big time for this. Of course, nobody will be prosecuted.",disgust
Check out this article.  Remember I was telling you the other day about that man from the bank who approached me in the market?  He was asking about my savings plan and long and short term goals.  He also asked about my mortgage.  I bet he has the same pressures as the bank workers in Pennsylvania.  So shady!  I would never want to work under that kind of pressure.,sadness

I can;t imagine having to go through this, especially since the custody seemed to be agreed upon.  Her ex husband doesn't seem to be thinking about Wylie's best interest - only his own.

Further upsetting is to hear about the animals effected.  Elephants invading villages, being electrocuted, hurting humans, all because their land is being taken for coal.  Sad! People are dying from lack of fresh air and water, and it is wrong.",sadness

This is a very sad article. Being of of the first female fighter pilots must have given her and her family great honor.

It must be extremely difficult to find these lone wolf terrorist. I can only begin to understand the type of manpower needed to pursue these people.

There are immigrants in this country that are having a hard time assimilation in to the American Culture. The article blames Trump I believe there are most things at work here than just him.

There was another gunman attacking random people in Houston. I think it's so scary and disgusting. Mental health these days seem to be at a all time low and it's showing left and right.

This is so disturbing. It says that they are killing chickens that are still awake during it. It's like they like torturing them. Why can't we be like Europe?

It's something, designed by quacks, that is supposed to convert gay or queer people to heterosexual. Are you kidding me? People are who they are in life and are not to be changed, but embraced and supported. The regimen these poor people had to go through in this so called therapy was barbaric, and would not be used in North Korea as a torture.

Sometimes the articles have so many names of places I don't recognize and can't pronounce that I get a little off track of the point of the article.

I feel like something should be done to improve the situation, but it's been bad since I was a kid and I doubt it'll get better.",sadness

Situations like this make you feel so helpless. I mean it's utterly awful but there's nothing you can do about it. Reading about it just feels like needlessly troubling yourself. There's a feeling of guilt too because the whole situation was brought about by the US invading their country and we could've prevented that.,sadness

I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.",anger

It indicated that the tobacco lobby results in weak tobacco control and a low effort among politicians to try and stop people from smoking. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why I should care about smokers. The evidence is there for them to see, yet they persist in their bad habits. Government can only do so much and it makes little sense for me to worry about another person's health when they are consciously making the decision to kill themselves.",neutral

The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.",disgust

The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF. The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place. I'm tired of constantly hearing about people getting away with white collar crimes.",disgust

I wonder if they have relatives that might be willing to take them in.

Perhaps there was a spat between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a traumatic incident. Either way, no good comes out of this entire situation.",sadness
"Well nothing about this article was suprising to me.  I'm sure it wasn't to you either.

Interesting that South Korea has the most patents per people though.",neutral

This sounds like a murder-suicide situation. That's what it always is when you hear there is no danger to the public. How awful that people choose to do this to each other and how awful that some poor kid had to be a witness to it all. That child will never be the same again. I wonder why people who choose to do something like this can't just kill themselves and leave everyone around them alone. It's sick.,disgust

It's also sad how the police officers ran away which was I guess the main point of the person telling the story. That is very corrupt and wrong, they should have stood up for the Rangers being targeted. I think it's best if the wildlife is preserved and the community that attacked the Rangers were clearly out of line.",sadness
That's a really strange and messed up situation. It's really sad for the children involved and it's very troubling that any country could plan out such an awful attack.

That is really sad to hear. It's awful that cars can be so unsafe and sometimes people forget how easy it is to get into an accident if everyone isn't careful and observant. It said this happened at 6:30pm so I wonder if maybe the sun was shining right in someone's eyes because that has happened to me at sunset and I could barely see. It's difficult to pull over and stop in those conditions as well.,sadness

People don't have to be so easily offended these days, but they are, and they're hate filled while they're offended too.",anger

And then people are perfectly fine pinning it on an entire community and that's not fair becuase it really had nothing to do with the community itself and was more of an individuals decision,sadness
it's dissapointing that in this day and age that homosexuality is still illegal in different countries. I would think that it would be past that and that people would just get over it. It took forever for America to recognize gay marriage so I guess it's not surprising that Uganda hasn't yet. But I still think that it's a breach of human rights and it's moraly wrong,sadness

I wonder about the reference to the cattle, thinking that might have something to do with it.  Scary stuff!",fear

It sounds like a severe case of pneumonia, but from what, how and why.  And the fluid on the brain of the one sister is so strange.  I would think they would know more after the autopsies, and I don't understand why that is taking so long.  I'm thinking that the family wants to bring the bodies back to the States and that could be holding up the autopsies.",surprise

I think there was a group of kids that started arguing with the guy and one got pretty riled up and hit the guy.  I find it interesting that there were things that were not being commented on.  I think there's a lot more to this story than what the school is reporting.",sadness

It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.",disgust

Apparently, the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below.

Those poor people, they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so badly.",sadness

Those poor people got tricked into getting their photos stolen and this man went and was showing them to everyone. He finally was convicted of this and it serves him right. What an idiot.

Man, they really have it pretty bad with all of the stuff going on. I feel really bad for the people who are living there that really don't want any part of what is going on.

"I feel like the Syrian war situation is just completely out of control at this point, but what often bothers me more is that people who supported Obama for both terms had a sort of blind spot on this issue. When the Arab Spring happened and then the Libyan war and now the Syrian war (et cetera) there was very little meaningful opposition to it from the Democrat-voting side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers just pretended to be opposed to thwart Obama, if they even did that. In reality, the whole government supported ""removing Assad"" and because that objective was considered SO important, now we have the current situation of extreme tragedy. I feel like it is hard to convey how important this is.",sadness
There have just been so many different tragedies involving the sinking of migrant boats that the people who live in Western countries have become immunized to the images.

I think it is really just crazy.,surprise

It is like they want people to have a negative opinion about this issue, so they subtly frame it in a certain way.

Anyway, I wonder how the pipeline protest movement is going to continue under Trump.",anger

Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems.",disgust

Make sure you are taking your pets to a reputable kennel if you do need to board them - I would have to see something like this happen to anyone else!!,disgust

I don't like her policies anyways!",anger

Here in Detroit, we see it all the time and I know you're in a similar situation in Philadelphia. The article doesn't give any details about the victims or anything like that. It almost dehumanizes people, don't you think? I mean, these victims were somebody's relatives. Hopefully more details will come out in future articles. The news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details. I know I am rambling here. But all this gun violence is too much.",surprise

I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident.

I remember back then, when all the polls showing wins for Hillary and the Democrats. I haven't trusted the polls since then, and I know you don't trust them either. And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again? We have to keep an eye out and do whatever we can to make sure there's no funny business at the polls in November.",anger

Not to mention the fact that Vietnam and Iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place. I worry we're headed for another war, and with the VA in the state that it's in, how can they possibly care for more war veterans? They can't meet the needs of the ones who already need help. It's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re-experiencing the war over and over again. However, I am glad to hear that there is help for people who have PTSD. I remember when we were kids and first hearing about PTSD in Vietnam vets, it was thought that no one ever recovered from it. Healing is possible, but the vets have to find the right people to help them.",sadness

The elections nowadays are just so unrelenting. You have to spend a lot of money on campaigns and trying to put down the other person. It's a wonder that man doesn't spend all his money that he has earned. I don't think he even got a chance to tell anyone what kind of person he is. He gets torn down before he has a chance to do anything. I'm just so mad at the whole election system and the way things are done. Everything about your past and present gets brought up and nothing you do can go unnoticed.,anger

I wouldn't want anything to happen to my baby. This person thinks that we should just put girls in a room with infected mosquito's and let them get bit. I don't think you can prevent immunity that way. I don't think this virus is just going to disappear. I think something has to be done to prevent it from infecting more people. It needs to be controlled. I think it is sad for those that have already gotten the virus. Something has to be done to help these poor people.,fear

It is shocking to me that some people can have so much anger in them to do something like that. That person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones can't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card. I guess we need to have security every where nowadays it seems. No place is safe to go. You can't even go to the coffee shop without worrying someone is going to pull out a gun at you.,fear

I'm wondering if this will end up with the US trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here. It is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want peace. There is always terrorism and someone trying to bring down a country, but the country tries its hardest to fight back despite opposition.",sadness
I just read an article about how Billy Bob Thorton felt about his marriage to Angelia Jolie. He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.,sadness

They take up selfish ideology because they don't like something, instead of just disassociating with it. This greatly saddens me, for I have seen the world in all it's wonder. Where the majority of people just want to live in peace, without boundaries. Yet this idea of cultural heritage has become disastrous further dividing people. If only more people could set aside their petty ideals, and just accept each other as other humans. Instead we classify and further separate ourselves due to every difference.

Society it's self is a disgusting community of work till you die. No matter what it is you chose to do. Take Autism for example, we try so hard to normalize them. However with my experience these people are brilliant in their own ways that we can't understand. They see things in an alien like manor of ultra basic instinct.

Kids run away all the time from home with no skills, or means to get by. Many of them end up making it out ok. Some don't, but it's usually due to making the wrong choices. Taking the easy way out.

They keep painting a pretty picture, and we all live in this illusion that life can be great here or there.

A tragic event would have been even more tragic had he not been there to save those people. I feel bad because those individuals (including the guy who saved the passengers) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same.

Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression.

Another article I read showing a death of African American driver by a police. I really upset me reading this article. That unnecessary force was used to handle the situation. Its crazy that the first thing on the police mind is to shoot to kill.

Understandable that they work in a high intense environment but that why they train and follow protocol.,disgust

I just read this article about a wolf being killed after traveling 700 miles  by a government agent . I don't understand it ! There was no reason for it . It hadn't  attacked or disturbed anyone so what was the point of it all ? I feel like anymore people just kill animals to kill . This is why one day so these animals will be extinct .

"I guess people don't realize how much of an impact they can have.  The article says if people would have done something they could have stopped the extinction of the animals.  But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.  But what is the solution the problem they are talking about?  How should people intervene to save those animals?",sadness

I don't think I would want to go to that place again to surf if I was a surfer.  I think people need to be cautious when surfing.  I don't think it is really our place to force sharks away, as they live in the water.

Sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done. Now before you jump to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees fault let me fill you in some more. Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts. So basically the people in charge over there thought that it was a good idea to screw over their account holders and give their low-level employees crazy quotas, all so they could make more money.

I did not get too many details about all of the evidence that they have against her but to me at least it does not seem like they have that much evidence. I guess she ordered her friend a coffee before her friend got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died. Pretty crazy, right? I think she probably did it but their motive is weak and I do not think that she would have been found guilty if the trial was going on in the US.",surprise

What makes this one worse than the usual is that there were chances that she could have been helped but she was turned away. They said that she was ""over the worst of it"" but other evidence suggests that she was not. To me it seems like people did not want to deal with her for some reason or they were on a small budget and could not afford to treat her so they turned her away. Very sad and very messed up that you turn away someone whop wants helpa dn they then kill themselves. The system needs to be fixed.",sadness

These politicians are probably going to benefit financially somehow from this deal . It is the only explanation that makes any sense to me. Why else would you destroy a whole community?,anger

But there isn't a smooth process put into place for that.  Even the Vatican is trying to assist, but to no avail so far.  I can't help but think of all the problems the US has lately, but we do have a constitution and a system for change.  I am not sure how Venezuela will fix things peacefully, and how its citizens will fare through all this.  The article made comparisons with Cuba, and previous leadership, but I did not fine a clear solution.",surprise

There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.

The article mentioned her providing information about her expensive diamond ring on Facebook - I think there's a lesson to be learned about that.",fear

While California passed clean water acts to remedy this, it has had trouble providing for the poor in unincorporated areas such as Methany Tract (sp?).

It indicated that Trump had a simple appeal to the darker side of people, the look out for myself and not others side, it explored Trump's ability to partner with those that are hurting and feel left out of society through lack of jobs, etc.  He used this association to promote his agenda, with simple phrases that were easy to remember, and tailored it to the good old boy network.  The article didn't really explore Russia's influence on the election, only addressed Trump's appeal to certain groups.",neutral

I am deeply disturbed by what I have read in this article. It seems that a man committed a senseless act of murder by pouring flammable liquid on an innocent bus driver and setting him afire.

The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high.

"Hey, I just read this article today.  It takes place in 2011 and is about an inmates at a federal prison that had to choose between living with a violent cellmate or end up in shackles.  In the cell they had to spend nearly 24 hours a day together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space, can you imagine?   I learned that they have a form of punishment there and it is called ""four-pointing"".  They cuff each limb to the corner of a concrete slab or bed frame.  That just sounds like torture to me.  The guy that the story is about is serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking and assaulting a corrections officer.  This prison is known as the toughest prison and I can see why.  You really should read this article, it is very eye opening.",surprise

It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.

Some where hard to even tell if it were human or not.  They still can't figure out how they died but they will soon enough.

It's very upsetting to me that people feel they still need to poach elephants and rhinos just for their ivory. It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals. If that's possible.,sadness

The both of them fell off a cliff and died recently while exploring the outdoors. There was an attempt made to recover their bodies but the exact cause was not specified. Poor souls. I pray that their family may be given strength as they discover the tragedy.,sadness
"This is just such a sad situation. I wish they had been able to find out more when they investigated, but I guess they can't always get it right. I really feel for the father. He did what he could to stop his son and he wasn't able to. It reminds me of a certain person I know whose family member was involved in a different kind of violent extremism. Sometimes people you love go on terrible paths and you don't have enough information to do anything until it's too late.",sadness
"The human rights groups are right. It is brutal. I'm glad we don't punish people like that in our country, but I also feel like this guy in question deserves it. The problem is that punishments like that end up being applied to people who don't deserve it too. In this particular case, I don't feel bad for the guy at all. He's a monster.",disgust
"Those poor little babies. This is just going to keep happening more and more. The rate of human caused extinctions is going up at a scary rate. I know pandas and polar bears are kind of the face of conservation, but they're not the only cute animals out there. And even the ones that aren't cuties matter! Extinction is such a huge, huge deal.",sadness
"Wow, this is tragic. I really hope that China will improve their safety standards, but I know this is a big problem all over in developing countries. Remember when that factory burned down in Bangladesh? And we can't pretend this isn't our problem too, when we support them economically. If we buy products created in unsafe working conditions, we have a hand in those deaths too.",sadness
"Oh, Yahoo. I wonder what country they're talking about? Probably Russia. It's always Russia nowadays. I'm glad I stopped using Yahoo years ago. I feel vindicated.

"Another Taliban attack in Afghanistan today, this time directed against the Germans. A few dead and many wounded, primarily women and children. They said it was in retaliation against US air strikes that have cause a lot of civilian casualties. An endless cycle, just like before. Remind me again why we're there.",sadness
"How sick is this. A visitor at Busch Gardens in Florida attacked a flamingo. Park staff had to euthanize the bird because of its injuries. It seems the flamingo did some sort of unique dance and had become quite well known for it. The guy is being held on bond, charged with animal cruelty. They ought to throw the book at him.",disgust
"Can't believe the jury failed to convict the people involved in the National Wildlife Refuge takeover in Oregon. The people weren't even from Oregon. They traveled half way across the country, invaded the facility, and barricaded themselves inside.

A moron Arkansas cop left her police dog in the patrol car in the middle of summer and the poor thing died. She's on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated. What's to investigate? The dog didn't lock itself in the car. She should at least be immediately fired for being too stupid to be a cop.,anger
I was sad to hear that a woman was critically injured Sunday evening in a multiple car wreck in the Clinton area of Prince George’s County. It seems like these things are becoming more common. At least the reporting of such accidents is more common. People should pay more attention to their driving. I wouldn't be surprised at all if someone involved was distracted by cellphone use.,sadness
I just read an article about how the CO2 levels are high this year and they might not lower for generations to come. That is so sad for our children and grandchildren. I feel like instances such as this can cause health issues. Not only am I concerned about myself but Im concerned about my children and future grandchildren.,sadness
This article is so sad the hatred and anger we have towards one another in America needs to stop. Our children and grandchildren are going to grow up in a horrid place simply because we have people in our country who refuse to let go of the past. The past is in the past so let it stay in the past for crying out loud.,sadness
Another sad story. I am deeply sorry for the families of the innocent civilians that were killed but our United States army has to do what it has to do in order to protect our great country and keep us all safe as Americans. Living in those types of countries is a risk and sometimes innocent peoples lives have to be taken in order to keep us safe and protect our country.,sadness
It’s a sad day when young kids are killing themselves. They act on impulse and do not realize that their actions have lasting consequences. If someone was just their to listen to these kids a lot of this probably wouldn’t be happening. Its just so sad especially for the parents and grandparents but also for the whole family.,sadness
"Trump refuses to take a salary from the government for being president. Well he is rich so $400,000 is probably nothing to him.

"What a disaster...I can't believe their course of action is to do nothing too. I can't even imagine how this is going to affect the local wildlife. They should be funding environmental groups to help the local animals in any way possible. This is going to have far reaching consequences too, as the poisoned fish and birds will affect other species and they'll end up effecting us as well.

What a shame. I wish the article went more into detail about what happened to the actress and the guy she was with. I'm assuming they just broke in and then used tear gas on the couple? How did they escape from the masked men? Or did the masked guys just steal stuff and then leave? I'm not sure what the gun laws in France are but these reports would make me feel uneasy there.,fear
"Did you hear about the Taliban attack on the German consulate in Afghanistan?  If not, they set off a bomb at the gates and then an attack ensued.  About 130 people were injured with 6 or so dead.

I feel sorry for all the injured, especially the children. I'm not sure the UN is making things any better either...",sadness

No doubt they have every reason – the young women and girls feel veil-less freedom!  The IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

"What won’t people post?  Some mom posted a picture on Instagram of her 2-day-old C-Section scar to remind people that it’s no picnic.  I guess it’s an unsolicited public service message of sorts.  She had some sort of tumor that made it necessary.  She had the baby and that’s the god news.  Surprisingly, she got about 1200 “likes” in total.  I found myself wanting to out of sympathy.

People in America are going to have it worse despite all the federal “inequality spending” done during the Obama administration. The article says that Trump and the congress are going to undo what Obama started. The article says that they are also trying to undo Obama care and that’s part of it.  I know Obamacare made me poorer by about $600 a month and I’m not rich!  It goes on about SS and how evil tax cuts are.  I don’t know what to think about this since the news these days are often fiction.  It seems to contradict itself by saying unemployment rates have dropped.  With more people working isn’t there more tax revenue?  Confused but I feel for the poor...,sadness

It is about a Representative named Darrell Issa, he is a Republican and has a Southern California seat. How great would it be, to see this massively bad man lose?

For example, say someone above me has a child who is playing with the stove and the parents are unaware. I fire could start and all of that is beyond my control.

Wow! I cannot believe I forgot about the Zika virus! How can we advance as a society to try to grasp a better understanding of this deadly virus? You would think as advanced as human civilization is we would understand more. Pregnant women who get Zika seem to be in the most danger. The effects it can have on the fetus is horrible! It is very scary to know that it can be passed along sexually even if a person was not feeling the symptoms.Africa and Asia seems to really need help fro the rest of the world in fighting this problem!,surprise

Their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always prevent attacks even whey they are forewarned about a specific person.

With extremist like this guy, when they already had him once, I think more severe tactics are necessary to protect the country and its citizens.

They make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are older people who don't always want to go through the hassle. These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of.

No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim.

I tried to immagine what it would be like to live in such horror. It mentions many post on social media of pictures and videos. I would be interested in seeing some of the pictures and videos of this violence. Reading stuff like this really makes you appreciate being in America.,sadness
"I just read an article about the hate and racism in America since Donald Trump won the election. It talked about ""countless acts of hate"" beggining from day one of Trumps presidency.

I recently read an article about how the band Eagles of Death Metal visited the Paris attacks memorial. A year before they were playing at a concert hall when the attacks occured a year prior. Sting was the first person to play at he concert hall since the attacks. The front man of the Eagles of Death Metal was denied access to the event. He had told Fox news that the muslim security collaborated with the attackers at the concert hall.,neutral
"I just read an article about suicide, it was really sad. It started off talking about a 12 year old girl who was interested in suicide groups online. One day she went to school, or so her mother thoght. The mother recieved a phone call from the channel A&E notifiing her that her daughter had took her own life. The article went on to say how Russia was third in the world in suicides. It was a really sad article.",sadness
"I read an article about how a man killed himself after killing his wife. It sounded like the man really had some problems. I dont understand how you could kill someone that you say you love.

The hospital confirmed that the woman had passed.",sadness
I feel very sad for the civilians who are caught in the crossfire. It's sad that people are stuck in the middle of this conflict. I wish there was a peaceful resolution. Both sides should really keep the ceasefire if only to protect the civilians who are caught in the middle. Those people have no control over any of this.,sadness
I feel bad for the migrants who died when the ship which was carrying them sunk. Especially the young ones. Kids shouldn't have to die like this just trying to take a risk to improve their lives.

It's a little bit troubling that these teachers would be forced to leave because of political tension. It's not right that they would lose their jobs and their homes. There should be another way to resolve this issue. It's good that people are protesting this and they should be. Teachers play such a huge role and it will not be good for the students to be in the middle of this.,anger
I think justice has been served one way or another. This person seemed like a danger to society. I think it's only right they should meet their end in this fashion. People like this should be removed from society before they do something that will hurt others. I feel bad for anyone who was in danger from this mad man.,sadness
Can you believe how people are acting over this? They are acting like a bunch of rabid animals. This is not how you protest. Going around acting violent and destroying things does not solve anything. This is chaos. There is no excuse for this type of behavior just because you don't agree with an election.,anger
"I just read another article about clashes over in the middle east and I am sending it over to you. This kind of thing has been going on forever ,,, my whole life and I have to admit that I am becoming immune to these types of stories and lost all empathy for these people. Normally you would read a story such as this and be heartbroken for the women and children who lost their lives but there is a story (or 2 or 3 or 10) like this every day and for decades and no end in sight. So just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered. Herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your concious. Too much insanity and too much gore to think about so the healthy thing for you do is just ignore these stories since there will a new one or two or ten tommorrow and forever",neutral

I am a cat owner and they are always ""skitished"" and afraid so my first thought is how terrified they must have been and then how awful the children must feel. The horror of imagining your pet burning (though they probably died from smoke). The children will not understand and it will take awhile to forget.",fear
"Another story that I am sending about Janet Reno. Thought she lived a good and long life, I always felt sorry for her and always wondered why she accepted the tough job of Attorney General. I felt sorry since she was often attacked for not only political reasons but her appearance also. She was unattractive and somewhat manly looking and the media used that against her. Made fun of her. This article mentions an encounter with Eleanor Roosevelt and her looks remind me of Janet. So maybe that is why she took the post. Wanted to be like her hero.",sadness
Here is another interesting story but this one is about squrriels and leprosy. In the UK they found that red squrriels are getting leprosy and that never happened before.

Maybe his golf curse has to catch fire just like the forests. This doesn't only effect us but the whole world and the life on it. United States needs to take action before it's too late.,anger
Terribly sorry for all the families affected by this incident. I confident that the Russians had something to do with this. They interfered with our election too. They are corrupt and shady.

A lot of these news go unnoticed I feel. We have war in Syria and war everywhere. We have accepted it as a part of the world. It's such a shame that it's like this.

It saddens and scares me that people don't see terrorists for what they are: radicalized individuals who have gone rogue.

Not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming, but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem acceptable.

He is now trying to distance himself from Trump because polling suggests that supporting him is not in his best interest for reelection. This guy has no morals and should not be supported for his constant flip flopping.",neutral

I am not making excuses for what happened. Surly its tragic but lets not pool a whole race of people into a negative basket because of one or two bad eggs.,neutral
This is a bizarre story.  A man bashed a turtles head with a hammer in self defense.  He is being held on 5000 bail.

Claiming self defense against a turtle seems crazy. I think the man could of just left the turtle alone and not of been in this situation to begin with.,surprise

I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply.

"I just read about some girls losing their parents. It was very bad. They went to a theme park to enjoy themselves and their parents were killed in front of them. It was a water ride, the kind that seats six at a time. Something mechanical happened on the ride. The maintenance check a few days prior was good, but something screwed up. There were four adults and two girls. The ride flipped over and trapped the adults. The little girls somehow escaped, but their parents were among the four dead. Apparently, the park workers didn't even notice it right away. One of the girls was by the ride exit by herself. The girls may need a lot of counseling for the rest of the lives. It was pretty bad.

I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored. It's an important issue.,anger

And im not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0% waste.

Hey. I just read an article about Somali refugees in America and I had many thoughts. I understand where these refugees are coming from. Having to leave their home and come to a foreign country where they don't know many people and having others not want you there. I understand that they had to leave their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but I wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder. It's hard to come here as an immigrant and I'm sure way more harder to come as a refugee but taking initiatives to push forward and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible. It did make me feel sad for them. I wondered if it's possible to give them more aid  based on working or something to reward them for being a member of society.,sadness

"France Dismantles 'The Jungle' in Calais — A small camp in Calais, France, housing nearly 8,000 migrants hoping to cross into England, is being evacuated and torn down in what French authorities are calling a “humanitarian” operation. The migrants, fleeing their homes in Africa and the Middle East, are being relocated from the camp known as “the Jungle” to centers across France. Some have decided they do not want to leave, and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents, trailers, shacks, and makeshift shops in the camp.

My understanding is that the water is becoming less potable as the pumping is going deeper being contaminated with arsenic.

You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.

They used the personal stories of a couple of people to show how the ready availability of guns contributes to sad situations in which kids are shot and killed. It wasn't as well written as a lot of journalism in this area, but it was pretty interesting to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed. One involved a violent adult who went on a rampage and shot an ex-girlfriend's child and another person. The other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up shooting and killing the other, claiming it was an accident.

That’s the way another arbovirus, chikungunya works, he wrote in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases last year. “The rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we’re heading, within a year or two, to achieve sufficient herd immunity for this virus to die out,",fear

This really saddens me that people are so lost now a days. It never solves anything to hurt other people and this just shows a lack of judgement and remorse.

It is sad that people have nothing better to do than to get into other people's business. It seems that we are at an all time low as a society and that there is no respect for other people's privacy.

"The United States should be ashamed  of how this last election went. It was sad that they could not be fair to other countries in the campaigning.

There are no words for how much I ignore Trump and his antics. It has made me numb and lose hope in the whole system. I no longer feel anything loyalty for America or its system.

Why was this problem not addressed long ago by the landlord?

"I can sympathize with what these parents must be feeling. Not because I have raised a pre-teen, but because I can vividly remember that time in my life. Middle school is hard, ugly, and scary.

Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship! Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe. A new mattress if you can swing it. Company provided mattresses are typically pretty garbage.

From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that. Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!! He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting! This guy doesn’t like fox hunting because “toffs” do it.

Enjoy all the snow this weekend, we're barely getting anything in Iowa, which is frankly ridiculous.  Thats absolutely disgusting. Newsflash: Ugly people cheat, too. Cheaters cheat.

I have listened to him and that's how I know he's a terrible person and his goal is to turn impressionable people into terrible people like himself.

Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans. The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division  The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself. Yeah the question makes no sense without more context. This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead.., She sounds hideous. Sign my name to it too lol it was so awful we deserve pain and suffering for that! ",disgust

That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act. This series is so unapologetic in its outlandishness that I just can’t help but love it. Nevermind, I see now Yikers  to google cuz I wasn't alive back then but damn I like em. Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.

Sit down to pee at home, the splashback is real. Especially if you're tall.  Reading on that sub makes me sick. That’s a weird way of spelling Tobin. I agree. Pockets especially on dresses just feel weird. Isn't she like a worse version of [NAME]? I always hear from everyone that she is pretty trash. she disrespected [NAME], i dont like her On VPR yes she is awful. On WWHL she seems very nice, and likeable.

"[NAME] type awkwardness that some thots go nuts for. You’re right, this is absolutely terrible Not to be critical, but “rethuglican” is an awful one  The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME].

I hope he loses his job over this. What a lowlife piece of shit.

I only remember the one in the movie (which did kinda weird me out) ",disgust
"Got one, it's still bad dude Underrated comment. Calling people on the internet “sweetie”... sweet [NAME] I love this sub. The cringe hurts so good. Those pearls are the worst, ugh. Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions. Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting. Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow. Unhhh has not been funny for a while now. This is definitely a terrible idea. Yea this past season her outfits were horrid It definitely doesn't work if you give up. I don’t *think* she’s awful, I know she’s awful. She has literally no redeeming qualities.  ",disgust

It's my job to vote my best interest I'll take the Akot 3 but man that shot is ugly My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid Crowder is terrible...

"There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful. That pedo ring that developed under [NAME] tenure makes him the worst owner of a sports team ever, bar none. He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy. Every time [NAME] opens his mouth...he says the same damn thing. Fuckin Finnish spitz out there bud Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume? The absolute worst!

Even more so. It would only make our prison (this world) even more diabolical. Man they must really hate [NAME] out of position at SF. But let’s play [NAME] at SF that should work. It’s an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a “No”. [NAME] was incredible this week. It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.

"So. Fucking. Tone. Deaf. Having sex with a child in the room is often difficult and boring. Me too I hope all goes well for both of us Whiskey isn't going to help.

Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party ",surprise

She must have missed you a lot. Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous. I wonder if, as an added bonus, [NAME] ended the cameo with a dic pic.

How’d you do it? ",surprise
"I was surprised to see [NAME] towing the line on his show. Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho It’s almost like a lot of Yankees fans are giants fans, and a lot of pats fans are Sox fans. So. Weird.

What is scary? It's been feeling strangely like November the last few***** I’m surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn’t molesting little kids.

Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them.. It seems as if you are the one that is unable to feel women.

I had always wondered when I would feel like an adult... according to this thread looks like it never happens ",surprise
"I watched the bomb episode today! [NAME] reaction is totally something I would do/say. The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j My goodness I didn't even know this existed. This is my first time seeing something like this. Pretty cool stuff. I think this is the first time I’ve ever seen this joke. What?! I am level 20 and I already had 4. I did 5 hide outs in total not counting the tutorial hide out. Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one... ",surprise
"Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food Wouldn't that be wonderful. You might be interested in this report on the divergence productivity and worker And oops AND a yikes. Maybe even as much as an OOF. Definitely a wow from me Also known as the song ice cream trucks play. I was wondering why it sounded so familiar! Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it.  23 minutes! Omg that's too long ",surprise
"Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie) Guess I hit a triple Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck Oh no atleast you found out early. I went to find help a year ago but you know i stopped going to that therapist Oh yóu! You can wait ten years to start working on yourself and get what you want or you can do it now. Very interesting!!! Oh and it would be nice if they didn't have to cover forever, lets get some pass rush in the off-season!! ",surprise
"woah this is a reversal of the norm you took a meme from instagram to reddit I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet... Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising. > If you hear something three times you are eighty percent more likely to believe it than if you only hear it once. Source? ...what? Haha I actually didn't know about its existence! I honestly wonder how much of that map I've actually seen though. So many hours. Lol I sould have assissted in the stabbing, even ceasar would have been surprised by the amount of stab wounds on that little shit ",surprise
"Precisely this. I don't see why this is such a hard concept for some people to grasp. Really? I was in New York last week and had to stand in the freezing cold to pump gas twice. I was thinking the same thing. It does make me wonder how whomever leaked it, obtained a copy in the first place.  Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip. Breaking news, husband borrows wife's car and should lose their job because of this This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh ",surprise
"Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling. AHHHH ZIMM! Fuck, my wife and I spent less than a *fifth* of that. Wow.  I find this sooooo strange I can’t believe only 3 people pet the cat. Not even the cameraman pet the cat! Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames. Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely [NAME] is really going to have to work his ass off to make this team. ",surprise
"Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out [NAME] has weird ideas about everything. Oh wow. Except gillette i haven't used aby P&G products in years woah this is a reversal of the norm you took a meme from instagram to reddit Wow they are on the cusp here. Definitely not fellowkids because I would totally believe an actual fellow kid said this Oh wow I genuinely thought this was funny can’t believe you copped it so hard How strange is it that it is only gun control enthusiasts think that compromise means one side gets what it wants and the other side only loses. ",surprise
"Without seeing the rest, it's entirely possible he's right. ""Everyone on reddit thinks it's true"" isn't terribly compelling. And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor! I drove through there dropping off an uber passenger and I was really amazed by how beautiful it is. Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now [NAME] damn, they using a young baseline. Like 1951 or something. Were warmer than just 1 C All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone! Eh, we all pay for sex one way or another. More power to you. ",surprise
"Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho Eh... that depends. If I knew the customer then I would, if not then probably not. Wow! Dudes lucky to be alive today! Who does that? Obviously drunk. Wow really? I would think that UK bases would be the last place we'd have protests at. Because [NAME] want to control you! Wouldn't that be wonderful. You might be interested in this report on the divergence productivity and worker Thank you for not making a cake day shit post Ok now I’m wondering what you’re on ",surprise
"Thought they would be his least favorite band Wow you're so moral you've changed my outlook on remainers Omg this is so cool thank you! oh my [NAME] Wow.

Dumbass Broncos fans circa December 2015. Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less.  Oh neat! I didn't realize you guys shot it. I figured the company had set up a tripod. In that case I retract my complaint. ",surprise
"Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days. Im just glad it didn't take any of that for us. I'm glad I didn't have to see a [NAME] screaming match Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways. So that's how people get their cars sideways in those crazy pictures. I'd always wondered. [NAME] is really going to have to work his ass off to make this team. Astounding. People died. And the church's response is ""Thank [NAME] that the caravan moves on!"" i had a weird feeling colts were gunna win the SB, should have put some money on it  ",surprise
"The fact that she told you your sex life is over is insane to me. Omg saucepan what a daring and unconventional look!!!11 I was wondering what that was! Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't. Landslide. Well, i really can not believe that in 21 century religion can offer solution for all the problems.  Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?! Right? I’ve never heard of it being made with French dressing. [NAME] fucking [NAME], that man is enormous. Hes been amazing, so good I've pondered about playing a 442 with [NAME] and him in the middle ",surprise
"So, [NAME] and [NAME] are over? Have to wonder why he thought marrying a 19 year old was the best thing to do! That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it Ha amazing I thought I was alone Get a ride to heaven. You think [NAME] wants to pedal that far! Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh This was amazing It is the recent patch most likely! This never happened previously. Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH. Just imagine how heavy that leg is... ",surprise
"I've never heard of this place. I know what we are doing next time we're up there! Wow, he showed some backbone. I’ve always been pretty ambivalent towards him, but this ups my opinion a little. This is a terrible idea Does she hate the men in her family too? O.O Look at the spine on that kid - he must get it from his mother! My god. I could have written this. This exact scenario happens to me too (including waking up at 5:30 on the weekend) I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised. ",surprise
"It’s a metaphor. No one cares how big his anatomy is. It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey! She got the gift that keeps on giving Wow, your ex partner sounds exactly like mine. Boom! You don't get anywhere professionally if all you're doing is is applying for jobs you can already do [NAME] cares like a father incredible You forgot the to be sure >:). It's ""a surprise to be sure"". Back into the hole with you!  Haha I didnt even notice. I guess it does. That's a yikes, no from me. ",surprise
"I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this. Seriously? I couldn't even remember the dude's name until about halfway through the season honestly. Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun. Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely A bag of pita chips is really $8? You're willing to lie about anything to shill for [NAME]. I know you’re playin but it wouldn’t surprise me if I hear this for real ",surprise
"Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education. Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less.  Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍 What a cutie! I didn’t know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D Given I had zero interaction I couldn't even be mad. I think I chuckled Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you Ahh well if some rando in reddit says something without evidence, that’s good enough for me! International association of medical doctors be damned! ",surprise
Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun. A surprise to no one. Absolute stud. Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long... So shocking a couple in their 20s in counseling isn’t going to work out. Aye but happy cake day mate. Omg!!! just saw an interview of her! Wow this [NAME] is a horrible mother!!! Oh my Gooood! 😱 Oh you know they’re BOTH going for it. Your amazing too! It’s so crazy how [NAME] went from being an elite goaltender to barely an ahl bum in a matter of 2-3 years. I cri ,surprise
"OMG was he really 5000 favorite? Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails? Refreshmentos! What's that? It's new! Oh no, [NAME] baby! WHAT is you doing? The music caught me off guard I can't believe this team beat Winnipeg last week, handily too. That effort hasn't been there since.  Wonder if her steel balls make the same sound, clanging together, when they're frozen? Is that seriously the story? I haven’t googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff Oh, he isn't dead, [NAME]  ",surprise
"I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday. We got a great view around 9pm before the rain! Damn, that shit's decarboxylated af! That'll get you nice and sleepy... I foresee a weed nap in the near future... I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party Happy cake day! Have a great day and year, cheers.  Oh okay ya never heard it called fabrics ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge. You president now? ",surprise

While we watch the private form of Operation Chokepoint with Patreon, it's bizarre that people don't believe this stuff is real.  This is a great idea. I'd even figure out where my printer ended up after I moved and set it up for this. Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before ",surprise
"I wonder why don't we share this planet together as human beings instead of slaving and being like robots... [NAME] Oh no! That’s my favorite! Nothing like losing an organ to get you to eat healthier. Philanthropy really scares some people, doesn't it? People did this to [NAME] too.  80%? You watch too much YouTube. surprise surprise! cbs loves this phony old wannabee ""bussy full of beans"" is an earth-shattering phrase Oh [NAME] all the cereal will be stuck soaking in milk until they get mushy and gross Oh wow I didn’t realize that *Claims to know Chinese people and Chinese culture* *doesn't even speak the language* ",surprise
"Literally what happened. Your video fails to show how though? I really like the colours but I'm wondering where that bit of shadow on the chin comes from. > The headline writers are misrepresenting her words (second publication I have seen in minutes that has done so). Oh wow I wonder why I drove through there dropping off an uber passenger and I was really amazed by how beautiful it is. This is not surprising at all. She's a fake trendy ""feminist"" with no perspective whatsoever. I wonder if, as an added bonus, [NAME] ended the cameo with a dic pic.  **I can't believe she held out for a full 24 hours before flip-flopping** ",surprise
"I am only sharing what my friends said, what their experience was. I found that a bit surprising. Homophobic AND racist. Yikes. I really like the colours but I'm wondering where that bit of shadow on the chin comes from. What? That is the most recent big meme, it's not cringy > Wolf Hall Sounds interesting ! You've inadvertently led me down a rabbit hole of historical wikipedia pages now... Oh, [NAME]  It was complimentary. Was it a fly? Quiet possibly. I’m surprised nyxl hasn’t done that with their overloaded dps roster, but a possible upcoming import limit might be the issue Oh, it’s you again. Here:  ",surprise
"Plenty of Aboriginal blokes on here who criticised [NAME] too. Everybody talks about this but I wonder if it increases the chances of prostate cancer. Do you know? Plot twist, she's accepted [NAME] as her Lord and Savior. How is this long AF? It's like 20 seconds reading. Omg I wish I were still there so we could brave this together. Let us know if you go! Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though. Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/ ",surprise
"Wow. Instant retirement money... I didn't think it was that bad tbh Plenty of Aboriginal blokes on here who criticised [NAME] too. Oh would you look at this.... [NAME] 12 min long? That other 1 min video spoiled me. Uhhhhh...it ain't cheaper than upstate especially the Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo area. It's much more expensive.  Omg a drop pass worked. 👀 For free? Tell him you ain no prude. You want $100 Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody..

Wow, you really missed the point, didn't you? I can't imagine buds being very hard to find in Hawaii HAHA so sorry. I've had a very slow day at work. Been hitting F5 repeatedly. Was surprised it wasn't already posted. The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was. ",surprise

Because [NAME] want to control you! Wow, “Social” Democrats betraying the revolution. Who would had guessed? Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads.

That season 2 opener was great and completely unexpected. I remember 2008-2010. Phones couldn't do that yet. Phones had 640x480 screens back then, and believe me, we were amazed by that.

"[NAME] is super happy. Nice. I’m glad When they touch my arm or shoulder while talking. Usually they do it with no sexual intent at all, but it still gives me butterflies.

It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people. ",joy

I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud. I had the biggest smile! You are very welcome. Happy growing. Keep in touch with your success. I have found that sometimes you can redirect their tantrums by asking them where their nose is. They wanted [NAME] to be in the cameo and both to wish her happy birthday as specified in the order ,joy
We don't care as much for 69. Hard to do properly. Glad it works for you. We prefer to take turns.

Can't wait to see this badboy in season 8 😍 😍 😍 When [NAME] listed him among Dragonpit characters i was so happy.  ",joy

"Born and raised in New Britain. Love these sodas. My son and I both enjoy taking pictures. It gives us pleasure. Part of the fun for us on vacation is taking pictures of new things. I have pretty bad anxiety and have recently adopted two kittens. I definitely feel less anxious when I'm around them as they are such sweet animals. Good. I want them to remain crazed. More winning for us. I enjoyed this nearly as much as I enjoy too many pints. Feels good man There's having fun and being a hoe, OP seem to assume what she is, so ni worries for her.  ",joy
"Reminds me to the movie [NAME]. ""I saw it in a movie, it will work!"" MR. STEAL YO' GIRL! Huh that guy seems cool, they'd probably lop his head off.  I do that with chili...

Downtown is inconvenient, look like you've gone full county, enjoy your strip mall  Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.

Haha came here to say this, that shit spun me out right proper it did! ",joy
"Once a week. It was a semi expensive seafood place, but it also had a poppin sports bar/happy hour vibe. An interesting place for sure  okay, enjoy living in ignorance and hatred My boyfriend is so much like your husband. I’m so happy for you to have him, he sounds wonderful.  Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!

It was so relaxing and beautiful <√9 Thank you a lot ❤ Looks like they did it to scare everyone else on the road as a dominance game. Give me $100 and I'll text you something fun. Sounds like paid sexting to me. Hey bro there’s no judging here Grew up watching avatar and [NAME] is one of my favorite video game protagonists, especially when RDR2 came out.  ",joy
"Had my first kiss last month at 22. It does feel great. Good job bro. That’s kind of what makes the “guest” response funny, how did it get there? [NAME] please don’t come to the USA.

"You have inspired someone to create something that is liked by others. Is v nice feel.

Stay wavy! Yikes. This kind of freaks me out. O.o love it 👌 Love it! It’s somewhat realistic. Maybe not that THAT degree, but I enjoyed it. Wow, I love the car ride idea. Thanks for sharing that!

"Ooh, and they make the joke be able to be known by everyone so viewer thinks they are special Woo hoo!!! Free at last! Now it's cheering for the two to come back Oh [NAME] imagining this tween screaming yaaass queen at a poor drag queen made me cringe into a ball When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch* I'm not sure I would be happy to live in hk for 5 years lmbo [NAME] instead of [NAME] for me, but glad to see [NAME] is doing well.

"I’m an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning. Enjoying it. It makes shaving my head easier. Glad she's not living in a bubble then....

"Glad we aren't all like you , the world would have sucked You'd look like that too if you just saw Snagglepuss going to the bathroom. Happy cake day bro... or ma'am.

Wearing your heart on your sleeve so to speak. [NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
