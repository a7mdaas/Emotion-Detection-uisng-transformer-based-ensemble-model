0,it is really diheartening to read about these immigrants from this article who drowned.  it makes me feel anxious and upset how the whole ordeal happened.  it is a terrible occurrence that this had to happen at the mediterranean sea.  thankfully there were some survivors.  the fact that babies were lost makes it that much more emotional to read all of this,sadness
1,the phone lines from the suicide prevention line surged after the election.  it also climbed when robin williams committed suciide.  thankfully there is this prevention line to help those in need who have sucidal thoughts but we need to condition people that committing sucide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,sadness
2,"no matter what your heritage, you should be able to serve your country.  her thai heritage shouldn't preclude her and shouldn't have been an issue in this debate.  tammy duckworth and her family should be congratulated on the services they have provided to this country.  any type of racism should not be allowed in a debate",neutral
3,it is frightening to learn about all these shark attacks but these surfers should be aware of the risks associated with the sport.  relocating the sharks should be a priority and it would be in the best interest to establish a moratorium on water sports until the shark epidemic is dealt with.  closing beach in australia is a good precautionary method,fear
4,"the eldest generation of russians aren't being treated properly and should have some sort of financial compensation.  they are living off very little per day financially and live in poor conditions.  after paying utilities, they barely have enough for food.  health care has also taken a turn for the worse because they can't afford to get proper health treatment due to the costs involved",sadness
5,"middle east is fucked up, I've honestly never heard of a middle east country such as Afganistan deporting people, the mention of it just sound funny, who the heck would want to stay in that shit hole country that has been infested with terrorists and child rapists? Perhaps those refugees are out of choice, honestly they should come to a better country such as U.S. or U.K, even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration, but I think they're quite tolerate to people from war torn countries",anger
6,"well first of all whoever wrote this article doesn't know how to properly divide an article into paragraphs, which made reading this article extremely painful, but nonetheless I do know after reading the article that Zika virus tend to stay in semen and vaginal fluid for extended amount of time, so it's obvious don't mate with people who have zika virus, and don't even think about having a baby, they're going to be defective",anger
7,"well well well, look at what we have well, the arrogant Kim Kardashian finally got what she deserves: being robbed for millions, the thought of it is bitter, considering it's a robbery after all, but think the other way, a rich superfluous gal as Kim, broadcasting her belongings on social media, I guess she brought this upon herself",disgust
8,"just another fucked up mental sickness of american police against its black residents, I honestly have no idea why they have to be so sensitive with their fucking guns, they shoot people as if people can respawn after being shot or something, police should think twice before taking out people's lives with no legitimate reason, I guess it's good that police have body cam, so the public can see what shame they are brining upon themselves",anger
9,"it seems a horny male college student has finally taken up the courage not to pursue love, but to rape his potential lover, what a disgusting act and moral corruption, the amount of emotional trauma done to the female victim is permanent and she would never feel safe again, I hope he gets to sentence to jail long enough he thought through",disgust
10,I thought the article was quite sad to read and disheartening to hear about the Iraqi people. I felt sad for them knowing their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a job. The economy they deal with is much worse than ours and I can only imagine how difficult it must be living there. I hope that it gets better in the future.,sadness
11,I'm sorry to hear that about Dakota's parents. Even when you are adult it must be hard to see your parents splitting up. No one wants that to happen and it's unfortunate that her parents couldn't work it out. I hope they are able to still remain civil around the kids and family. Just because it didn't work romantically doesn't mean it won't work at all.,sadness
12,Hearing about the violence going on over politics in the country is really sad and upsetting. It's easy to take for granted how we live and how lucky we are that we don't have to worry about people killing us on a daily basis. Our government is also democratic which means people have a voice. This isn't the case in some areas/,sadness
13,"I think almost everyone has an opinion on Hilary Clinton over Donald Trump. Many didn't expect Donald to win the election but here we are. So many political scandals unfolded and more continuing to unravel. Many didn't agree with Hilary from the Bengazi investigation and many didn't agree with Trump, but in the end that's just politics.",neutral
14,"It's so sad to see that world hunger is still such a large issue in other countries, especially when it seems like so much of our food goes to waste. Children passing out in the streets simply because they have no food to eat is heartbreaking. No one should have to suffer simply because they can't afford food. There needs to be another option.",sadness
15,"It's really amazing to me how much food we waste as a country considering how overweight and obese people are. I can't believe how wasteful it all is, if you think about it. A lot of the food we eat, we don't need, and then we throw away so much too! All that food belongs with people who really need it. I wish people would donate more and that restaurants could donate their unused food to homeless shelters.",surprise
16,"This is a crazy story with so many facets to it, omg. I mean on one hand, I don't support an eye for an eye. I don't support the death penalty and I don't support blinding someone. BUT on the other hand, this is a country where women really struggle and the justice system is not well developed. ALSO, he blinded a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL. What the fuck is wrong with this guy. So if this was in America I would not support it, but I don't feel right condemning the actions of an entirely different country for doing what they felt needed to be done.",anger
17,I've heard of necrotizing fasciitis before. It's really fucking scary to think that just from a tiny little cut you could get a disease that has a high likelihood of killing you. There's also a similar bacteria called naegleria fowlerii that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain. Nature is fucking metal.,disgust
18,I totally support these protesters. We've had trouble with oil pipelines here in Michigan. I feel like these pipelines are foisted on local communities without any care for whether it is good for the community and without adequate studies as to how safe they are from leaks and pollution. There are more important things in life than money and oil.,disgust
19,"I'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this. At first I was perturbed at the first article because I felt like the lady was being ridiculous. She weighs 500 pounds, so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight, the fact that she can't find a scale to weigh her doesn't matter. You don't need a scale to tell you're losing weight. Measure your body with measuring tape. But then I got to the article about the Mexican students and found it really horrifying. I can't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(",surprise
20,It's too bad that we are still in the middle east.  I wish Trump would just pull out of the middle east entirely so our soldiers will stop being targets for all the countries that hate us.  The longer we are there the easier we make it for them to inflict damage to our troops.  It must not be easy for them to be there away from their families.,joy
21,It's a shame that air pollution has potentially been linked to increased mental damage with young children.  We often don't take into account all the damage that the fossil fuel companies have done to our society.  We only praise them for creating the fuels we use but never tax them appropriately for all the damage that they cause us.,anger
22,It's a shame how troubled the middle east is and has been for the longest time.  I wish we could come to some agreement with the rest of the world on how to realistically handle the multiple situations in the middle east.  I feel that we should pull out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some guidance from us.,sadness
23,"It's a shame that we have so many random acts of violence in this country.  It seems every other week we have some massacre involving either guns, a right wing extremist or a muslim extremist.  I think what they have in common are either mentally ill people or people who are extremist in their world views and religion.",disgust
24,This is just one of the negative consequences of long term war in a region.  The hospitals in Yemen have been devastated by war and no diseases are starting to spread among the population with no way to control them without outside help.  I hope the people of Yemen will be able to find humanitarian aid soon to help them control the spread of disease.,sadness
25,"If you are using trumps name to make him look bad is not the answer here. I know that trump is not being a good president right now but lets not discredit his success. Somebody burned a church that is not related to Donald Trump at all, lots of Families go to that church. I think someone used this attack as an attack to Donald Trump because he is not affiliated with this and makes people look like he caused this",disgust
26,"I felt sad that the turtles are fading because of the habitat temperature rising annually. We, as humans can help I think by trying to not contribute to the increase of Carbon Dioxide consumption, we can stop global warming and try to help t he sea turtles from going extinct and so our children and grandchildren can see them in the future.",sadness
27,This shooting is a good example of how black people and people w are wrongly prosecuted by the police. Now in this articles this gentlemen is getting a re-trial since they concur that he didn't do such thing and basically had the police lying to the judge. Now he can be fairly be judged and not be discriminated,disgust
28,"Felt bad reading the article because tons of people are losing basically their lives. The wild fires are destroying their farm, things, and even their animals. Without all of those things they cant have a proper living through buying and selling crops or animals. I hope we can donate to an organization nor something to help them",sadness
29,"I feel for her. They couldn’t afford to cremate them on their own and help them, and the financial help they were entitled to as crime victims had not come through because the system today isn't going to help criminals. I hope the government now helps criminals through dangerous activities and make the world a better place",sadness
30,"I wish there was something more that I could do. This is getting out of hand, but it's kind of far away geographically from us. There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.",joy
31,"Climate change is extremely worrisome. And it is getting worse and worse every year. Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.",fear
32,It's shocking how little people care about this and how little Africa gets mentioned in the news. This is horrific when you think about the number of victims and the people who are harmed. I wish people could focus on this. It's ridiculous that people are getting away with this and it is a huge crisis on the level of other genocides in history.,surprise
33,I hope everyone is ok. I was in a small earthquake and it was extremely scary. A lot of people can die if you don't have safe buildings. I think there should be a major international effort to provide guidance for any nations in an earthquake prone region so that we can do a little bit to prevent more deaths when the earthquakes inevitably hit.,fear
34,"This doesn't sound too worrisome to me. If you are affected by depression, then you should decide as an individual to find another option. It's just a side effect, I think there are many medicines out there that have depression as a side effect. It is something that individuals should be aware of, but nothing critical.",neutral
35,"Here's an article about crazed person who murdered two unfortunate women overseas. Life is crazy. I can't imagine what the families are going through. Having to go to or being forced into sex work is bad enough, but for it to end like this is just sad. It feels like there's no place safe in this world to be a woman sometimes.",sadness
36,"Some people are just disturbed. Everyone is going to point to mental illness in something like this, but I fear that when things like this happens, it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill. I fear that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can classify someone as mentally ill by the crowd. Just finger pointing. I feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much time making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand.",fear
37,"Every time I hear something about ISIS, I can't help but think about the role the US played in its creation and the horrors that have come from the vacuum of power in the region. I'm thankful to be American when I read something like this, but also ashamed at the same time in who we've chosen to represent us, not just now, but over the past 30 years.",sadness
38,"You know I'm not a fan of religion in any context, but this type of thing happens everywhere. There's always some idiot who goes off and uses religion, bigotry, sex, gender, anything really as an explanation. It's sad that you read something like this and it doesn't even feel like news. Perhaps its just our access that's making this seem ordinary.",sadness
39,Reading stuff like this puts the refugee in perspective. There has to be something the international community can do that isn't taking in refugees permanently. The vast majority of these people just want to live and build something for themselves. It is of no fault of their own that they were unfortunate enough to be born within the fist of a crazed dictator.,sadness
40,"Hello, I thought this behavior was a thing of the past, but read this article, it is rather enlightening. I often think here in the US there is a great divide on how racial issues are dealt with, and the US is not the only one. There are many racial problems in other countries and that makes me feel hopeless for the future. If we can't fix the issues here in America, how can we critizice other countries?",surprise
41,"The fact that human beings are abusing the planet and each other is evident in this article. It is enough to get you depressed, read this so you can get an idea of how pollution affects third wolrd countries. Instead of going after industries (probably all American) with fines, they rather close schools because of the pollution and smog. Their health is being affected and not only that, the enviroment is being completely abused.",sadness
42,"How sad, if you get a chance read this and maybe share, it could be the difference for this person to find her family! Sometimes I see these announcements and I usually read and share them, I hope they find who she is and most importanly I hope they find her family and get her some help. I think the more people see, read and share this info, the bigger the chance to find her identity and family, imagine if it was someone you knew.",sadness
43,"I know this article is super wordy, but it is an interesting read, if you have a chance ad you are bored, make sure you read it. It is about how Democrats will move forward in the next few years to get legoslation moving. It has been hard with Trump in the White House for the whole country, but imagine being a democrat right now trying to push legislation that your constituents are asking about? What a time to be alive! We should all just try to make the country a lot better right now!",joy
44,"Reading about issues happening across the world seems foreign, but just think: any trouble anywhere in the world, the US is usually involved. I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.",sadness
45,"How disgusting is Wells Fargo? It's unbelievable the way they treated their tellers, and all those fake accounts? Can you even? I don't understand how this bank doesn't get shut down. You really should think about getting an account with a different bank, you know. What if your SS got used to make some of those accounts?",anger
46,"Oh, but global warming isn't real, right? We have all kinds of time to fix the problem, right? It's not humans, it's natural variation, right? Holy crap are we ever ostriches as a species - are we going to dig our heads out of the sand in time? Change has to happen, and it has to happen now, we can't wait for all the old white men who run things to die",anger
47,"That's incredibly disgusting. I feel like it should count as a hate crime, and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that incident should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their involvement. I really hope the LGBT community organizes some kind of boycott; Royal Caribbean should be made to feel financial pain for their negligence",disgust
48,"You know how you were having trouble sleeping? Here, read about people who have tinnitus - it'll put you to sleep. I feel like more should be done to help the seven percent who say their tinnitus is a big problem for them, though. That's the same as any other psychiatric complaint, right? If it's affecting your life so that you can't function normally, there should be some kind of help for you",neutral
49,"This is terrible, but what I find hard to believe is that there are still that many Yahoo accounts in the world that aren't spambots. Or some other kind of bots. Anyway, aren't you glad I got you on gmail? I'm glad I shut my yahoo account down a long time ago. You should probably do that, if you haven't, just for safety's sake.",anger
50,"I just read an article about America's refugee problem, that talked about the Somali community in Minneapolis. I can't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article; it just makes me sick to see any reporting that doesn't only concern the facts, with no editorializing by the author. I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.",sadness
51,"I just read an article about some chowder-head who used a hammer and a pick ax to destroy Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Wow, what a great protest. You sure showed him. Good job.  Lol, can you believe this garbage? Who has such a hollow and pathetic life that they don't have anything better to do with their time than commit petty vandalism because they dislike some politician? What a dingus.",anger
52,"So, I had to read an article about somebody named Kylie Jenner, and evidently she has some sort of makeup line or something. Anyway, evidently she must be popular for some reason, because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand. She put out some message about how you should only buy direct from her website. I guess a sucker is born every minute.",neutral
53,"I read an article about Typhoon Meranti. The article said the storm passed by Taiwan without actually hitting the island, which I suppose was a good thing, because evidently there was another storm in 2009, Typhone Morakot, that killed a bunch of people and did billions of dollars of damage. I'm glad I don't live somewhere where there's any inclement weather like that, it must be miserable to live on an island where it's hot and crowded.",neutral
54,"I read about this asshole Arcan Cetin who shot up a mall in Oak Harbor, Washington. Evidently before he did the shooting he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic assault. I guess it just goes to show that gun laws are a pointless joke; if this guy had been a decent law abiding person no gun law would be needed, but because it was a criminal and a murderer the law didn't do anything to stop him from shooting up a mall.",disgust
55,"I just read about a young male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a mate. That seems pretty awful. I am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his journey, only to see it end in disaster. Apparently it was a government sniper that killed him. I'm not sure why the government has snipers to kill wolves. If they are posing a direct threat, then of course animals must be killed, but I don't see that this wolf was threatening anyway. It seems dishonorable.",sadness
56,"I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count ""early deaths"" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate.",surprise
57,"Apparently another Christian was murdered in a Muslim land, and the excuse was that he blasphemed, when he had really just shared an anti-ISIS cartoon. It is no wonder that religious minorities in Syria supported Assad. At least he protects them. He probably has committed atrocities, but it seems every side has committed atrocities there.  This murder was in Jordan, and even though the Jordanian royals come off as urbane Westerners, there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme Islamism in some of the population. Christians are murdered all the time around the world, but this rarely gets attention in the US media, which is completely corrupt.",anger
58,"The whole ""police violence against blacks"" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of ""swatting"". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state.",anger
59,"Apparently there are now a lot of wildfires in the Appalachia area, and it seems people are going to try to spin this into a ""climate change"" story. It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the ""official"" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true. Why has a vast swath of temperature readings been ""corrected""? Most people don't even know about this issue.",sadness
60,"Funny how it always comes down the to the gun and not the person wielding it. People will always be able to get guns, legally or not. the issue is more with society treatment of young men. Too many single moms, too many kids being ostracized and bullied. But yeah, that's the gun's fault. i don't own a gun, but I'd be damned if I gave one up to those liberal fascists.",disgust
61,"This is what happens when you take in people from an archaic civilization.  All of these refugees need to be throw back into their mud pit. Their religion embraces hatred. Let them figure out how to live in peace in their own countries, then we can allow them into civilized world. Is it is now, I think all of Europe is doomed.",sadness
62,"This seems like a conspiracy reach, but the medical exams were either lying or the bodies were really never examined. The Poles have a reason to distrust Russia- Russia does itself no favors, no country in the World should trust them-, they have a long history of conflict. The reason we had Polish jokes in America a few decades ago started with Russian racism towards Poles.",anger
63,"you can't sleep too much or too little. What else is new. I'm sure there will be a high priced drug that can solve this issue. The scientists and government of America couldn't care less about the average citizen. Look at the food supply, look at all of the drugs they want us to take. it's all about money and has nothing to do with concern for our well-being.",anger
64,"Again it's all about the money. Corporate America strikes again. They leech as much money from the working class as possible as they sit in their office, finger banging their secretary. When their lies and misdirection is revealed, some fat cat takes the blame (along with millions of dollars of hush money, and the working class is thrown to the wolves and blamed for most of the misdeeds.",anger
65,"This story about the shooting at the airport is absolutely breaking my heart.  There is no reason for these violent gun actions to continue to go on.  Can you imagine if this had been our dad or other friend or family member?  I can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now.  The poor people in the airport must have been in a frenzy.  It had to have been scary to not know what was going on.  Especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead.  This one cowards acts caused so much turmoil and upheaval for so many people.  Can you imagine all of the money that was wasted because of his stupid choices.  Between flights being cancelled, rearranged, police officers time.  I wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this mess.",anger
66,"Did you know that the spread of cholera is so terrible?  I had no idea this was still such a daunting issue so many people face.  I agree with a line in the article that said ""The idea that people are still dying in 2015 of cholera is outrageous.”  I feel so heartbroken that people are dying simply because they don't have clean water and appropriate medical care.",sadness
67,Can you believe what this family has done to these girls?  They have treated these children so heinously.  It is insane that the police wouldn't do anything until they were basically forced by the media.  I can appreciate things that happened later to help these girls but this so unfair.  This breaks my heart.,sadness
68,Are you aware that only certain refuges are helped and accepted?  I can't imagine the heart break that they endure traveling so far thinking they are safe to be turned around and denied.  The whole system is so flawed.  There is no appropriate help for these people!  They have so many unfair hurdles to go through.,sadness
69,"Poor woman!  I hope that she is able to recover.  I hate to hear of anyone being in an accident.  I see that there were three cars involved.  I wonder if she was the other one critically injured.  I guess if there were were at least three people involved and only one was seriously injured, those aren't the worst odds.",sadness
70,"So apparently sea ice is becoming less and less which is a concern four our environment and all I can think of is how it will affect the animals in the ocean.  This cannot be good for the ecosystem.  Or is it? In contrast to the article, i remember seeing a whale die because the ice was so thick and they were trapped. Perhaps neither are good, but how do we fix this?",sadness
71,"So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.",sadness
72,This article was so sad.  I guess ISIS had killed many people recently in israel.  They were very rude about it and many people were at high tension worried they had bombs or traps set up as they were recovering and looking for more bodies.   They said the people of ISIS just dumped there bodies as if they were trash.,sadness
73,"So today i read about Vaughn, an actor I didn't really know his name but have watched or heard most of the shows and movies he has been in.  Today, i heard, he died at age 83 due to lukemia.  IT is very sad to lose such a well respected actor.  I guess his parents divorced at a young age but both gave him the genes to act.",sadness
74,"This is so sad.  Today I read about a lady who passed away November 6th and had shared many of her stories of her experiences in the holocaust.  IT's very sad to think there aren't many people left to share these stories.  I remember being in Junior high and hearing someone speak about it, and to think kids these days will never get that.  Thankfully, there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then.",sadness
75,"The first article never appeared, there was only a generic place holders and nothing to write about. I answered questions about my emotions based on how I feel right now and I'm writing this to explain that the article wasn't there. I hope that the following articles will appear and I'll be able to finish this survey as intended.",neutral
76,"It does seem silly that people in committed relationships are still affected by the donating ban, but I can also understand why such a ban was put in place. The trouble with anything is that when you try to protect some people, others rights seem to always be infringed and we're forced to decide which offense is greater and more important. I don't see why someone can't be tested, found to be clean and then give blood but I can understand why especially in an emergency when things can easily get overlooked the ban is a good idea.",joy
77,After reading this story I think the right decision was made. It seems to me that the man had no reason to shoot at those kids just because they were playing loud music. Sure music can be annoying but no one deserves to be shot over it. I don't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your ground laws. This was a simple case of someone making poor choices and now needs to pay the price for their actions.,neutral
78,It's such a shame that so much violence takes place over there each year. You'd think all the different factions would finally agree to disagree and move on but instead they just seem to want to keep killing. I understand why since so many different groups want to destroy the other side leaving smaller nations like Yemen to have to defend themselves since the other factions seem to be unable to leave in peace.,sadness
79,Overall the problem here seems to be that overuse of resources in a certain area needs to be stopped. Simply pumping more water isn't the issue and perhaps the fact that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that's looked into. There should also be some sort of testing and filtering system put into place to protect the people.,anger
80,"I can't imagine what it must have been like for the people who were caught up in this, how helpless they must have felt. Not having any recourse for so long, no one doing anything to right the wrongs, just feeling like it's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so long and happen to so many people. Maybe they feel some kind of closure now though.",sadness
81,"Reading this was infuriating to me. To see such casual disregard for life, both of the animals and those protecting them, in pursuit of money. And for what? Snake oil cures in Asia, superstitious nonsense, and rich people wanting to feel powerful.

Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote.

She trailed by 8 points in a poll released on Thursday, after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat.

Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.",sadness

I don't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment, but they're really important for a lot of economies where they are grown. I think that the article brings up a good point by saying that major companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a solution because they are being oversourced due to high demand for their products, so I think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut crisis. It just makes me worried about the environment overall because I really worry about global warming and I just really worry about the environment in general.",sadness

Pythons are really dangerous animals and I get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still, you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times. I feel like some people are not as responsible as they should be, and that goes for anything. People are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their desperate, never ending quest for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their personal safety on the line, and that's really sad and I think it really speaks to where we're going as a society as well, and it's frustrating.",sadness

I wonder why people who choose to do something like this can't just kill themselves and leave everyone around them alone. It's sick.,disgust

It's also sad how the police officers ran away which was I guess the main point of the person telling the story.

I think it's best if the wildlife is preserved and the community that attacked the Rangers were clearly out of line.",sadness

And who knows what the Russians are going to do this time around? No one has tried to stop them, so why wouldn't they try to interfere in our elections again?

It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.,sadness

I don't want to make too big a deal about this because it is a different culture and it would be difficult to get the full gist without knowing too much about it.  With that said, it's is pretty worrisome, in this country as well, how much people are telling everyone what they should and shouldn't be doing.  Live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is pretty ridiculous by any standard.",anger

In this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very dangerous precedent and things like this can happen.  Every person should be judged on their own merits.  Saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so insane and the public outrage leads to things like this.  I don't know for sure what this person's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some don't see law enforcement as people anymore and it makes their job so much more dangerous and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us safe.",anger

I don't like the cutting down of rain forests and believe that needs to end, but I think there are other answers.  Getting rid of a great food supply is not one of them.  Eating meat keeps us healthy and strong and may be the reason our brains grew to the size they did.  Many politicians would want our brains to start getting smaller and more compliant.  Getting rid of meat is not the answer and if we didn't waste time we could think of better solutions.",anger

I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol. They have had serious problems in Jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossing their border.

They are even forcing women to wear gloves to completely cover themselves, and accusing anyone who has even a cell phone of being a spy.

The incident of depression was magnified over 28% when taking the combination pill, and even went as high as 78% in the teenage population! Alternatives to the pill which are longer-acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in depression. One outstanding take-away for me in this article is the fact that women are only fertile about six days per month as opposed to men who are basically fertile every day, and yet the birth control burden falls on women. Hopefully men will share that soon.",anger

There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.

Management came up with a quota and incentive system where employees(who don't make very good money to begin with) would make extra money the more people they signed up to these new accounts.

It breaks my heart knowing this probably happens all the time in our country! That there are kids who, through no fault of their own, are set on a path that ultimately leads to their downfall and punishment later in life! There need to be changes made to the foster system so that there are more homes available and counselling for these kids so that they can learn at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming angry and bitter.

These people need assistance because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of.

No one disputes that his hands were up, and the other officer assessed the situation to require a taser, not a gun, and apparently, this scenario goes against training, so the problem was in the officer, not the victim.

This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong.

It stated that boy was helping his dad harvest food when he fell in this well that was only 1 foot wide and that no adults could fit in it to go down and rescue him! Can you even imagine what that father must have been feeling knowing that his little boy fell in this well while helping him and he could not get down there to help him! I just imagine how heartbreaking this whole situation must have been for the family and for the rescuers who spent days trying everything they could to get to him and potentially help him.

However, according to this article, this program is not working the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs A LOT of money! I was upset to read this, as I feel that the internet can be such a valuable tool in education, but then I really wasn't surprised at all to learn that the government isn't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is promising us citizens it will do.

I am sure it is only a matter of time before that also comes out. The more and more I read about him, the more and more disturbed I am to have him as a president and wish I did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots.

And now, we live in a world where we are constantly hearing about possible terror attacks or terrorists regularly on the news. It just makes me absolutely sick that this is the world I am raising my kids in and that we have to live in fear of someone trying to kill us or setting up bombs to surprise attack people.

They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them.

I feel mostly bad for the birds and sea life, which will obviously be affected.  You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.

The officer claimed she felt like her life was in danger. Terence was a good man with a good heart. He was a churchgoer and a father of four children. Hundreds of people mourned his passing.

My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It’s just about self control. ",fear
2880,"I’m not waiting for help, I’m constantly trying to fix it myself but it would be nice if [NAME] help came It’s horrible for me, way worse than your situation.

GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests. ",fear
2881,"Death by snu snu Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right. He did. Dems would have filibustered and you need 60 votes to force one to end. It's horrible and I love it and you should be proud. that looks like a nightmare. Cringe, dude. You’re really reaching.  This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth. ",fear
2882,"Yeah, I was thinking my boy was into them before that. But I doubt Panic! At the Disco would have peaked his interest. All of season 6 is terrible I'm ordained. When's the wedding? 🙋 This is a terrible idea. I don't know what I'm doing. She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life. I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this ",fear
2883,That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia death of fear is certain. Arizona in the summer is fine. Arizona in the winter when all the blue hair snowbirds come is absolutely horrifying. That creepy realization that everything [NAME] says is projection... That was jarring indeed. But why he wearing a mask?!?!?! ,fear
2884,"Ah, alt right thinking. Afraid of people who have anything 'upstairs,' or 'between their ears.' This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes .

Brutal. for a moment i got scared and wondered what was this doing here then i read the happy ending ",fear

Wasn’t close Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh I realize. I was too hasty in my conclusions. [NAME] didn’t just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn’t a dog fighter, he is a sociopath. ",fear
2887,"I was/am the same. I'm the one pushing forward with the divorce though. The feelings of loss and fear are overwhelming sometimes though. Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...? Careful, they scare away easily, but they will be back and in greater numbers. Or maybe you could just learn the match up since they already gutted him in the last patch. ",fear
2888,"I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety. Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor. creepy, the only way to make it more creepy is to leave it on her bed stand table to find it in the morning.  ",fear
2889,"That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now. Aha! This is my fear, that the gloss over key elements because they want to target a wider audience!

CREEP FACTOR MIDNIGHT ""virgins gonna be scared"" The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by [NAME] in this game is terrifying.

2892,"In case you're wondering, Nintendo does put a bittering agent in their Switch cartridges...and it tastes horrible.  *6 objectively [NAME] and [NAME] are terrible at their jobs.

No. And not near as much as a gun lol i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw ,fear
2896,"Looks like the next level of a horror character The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes. I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.

The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying ",fear

[NAME] is a character that means a lot to me, and it makes me happy that you like my portrayal of her. Pokemon Go has kind of helped me with depression, tbh.

2958,"Can we get actual delivery dogs? I feel like that would be so much better... =D It's funny to consider DMC2 had characterization DDR is enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, thanks to DDR A.

A super fun ride with characters I cared about. I mean… yeah? So glad to be at that age where the conversation would be more uncomfortable for them than for me. Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix. ,joy

I put Norilsk on my phone so I feel better when Chicago is crazy cold i enjoyed this a lot. i especially enjoyed ""Everybody bleeds a little when they brush their teeth "" When they touch my arm or shoulder while talking. Usually they do it with no sexual intent at all, but it still gives me butterflies.  Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time! ",joy

It's all good man, glad you shared it. Just felt I should defend my stance as well. Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene. I just draw for the fun of it tbh... But having ""success"" or getting recognition still surely feels nice... Don't give up :)! ",joy

",joy
3215,"This is actually funny OP, stop trying to be so negative This one's pretty fucking funny. Also LOL to that kid with that shotgun. The kick would break his shoulder in half. The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory. Funny a lot of rich kids think 100k a year is very feasible. I find this super relateable, I had no idea others felt the same way.  Ahh. Both of those are very good. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did. ",joy
3216,"Gonna be a much better game than the last one. So glad you guys are coming to carver I love a good leg pop I know it's Nightengale but he's saying upwards of 12/350.. ya no thanks. His name is [NAME]. He's kinda funny, you should check out his other work. Congrats!!! Happy for you. The realization is pretty grim. Can't say I'm terribly happy. My favorite parody in fact.

See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol 52k upvotes in 2 hours. That's Reddit for you! Congrats, guy! So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :( ",joy
3221,"[NAME] is not a guy I root against. Just hope we have a good enjoyable game I wish I could go, but I can’t. Do enjoy your time and I pray it is spiritually fruitful for you! I beta-tested Gwent. After all that and everything after launch, I'd still rather just play it as a minigame in Witcher 3. Financial security and the happiness of close family. Whoa I'm impressed he returned the pillow to its original spot. Awesome parenting. ",joy

Hey bud, I’d honestly try to complain a little less and I promise you’ll slowly become a happier person As someone named [NAME], I welcome him to Dallas Gang ",joy
3223,"It's good though because itll make you cherish the happy times while youre in them, instead of lookinf back on them. I swear the low budget is what made it even better! The gnome stick is quite possibley my favorite movie prop ever They look absolutely PERFECT together. I hope its that way in real life too. So happy for ya [NAME]!!! I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch. [NAME] is a happy boi!! ",joy

I'm 33 and every year I'm more sure I never want children. I am perfectly happy with my husband and our cats. ❤️ I'm so glad the Ontario government sold off that money pit. /s Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming. That's when they brew their second cuppa before work haha ,joy
3225,This is what I'm currently dealing with and I'm glad I read this. Nice reminder thank you lol. You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again I loved [NAME] as a little kid but I wanted jean's powers but I couldn't stand how goodie goodie her and [NAME] were. Glad you liked it! :) this made me smile. I laughed so hard at the blinker fluid part. You and [NAME] are proof that not all heroes wear capes. ,joy
3226,"You most def are a quality human. This story just warms my heart. I would enjoy Kreate a Kharacter. But it'll need a lot of help. They shouldn't let you put cubes and stuff everywhere like in SC6. I am happy to receive constructive advice. If someone is short, or not constructive, I will react to it. Glad to hear this gets easier. I want to visit Hawaii, but I've held off to avoid those feelings. Same with Portland sadly. :( ",joy
3227,"Good to know! *Makes note to Grand Revenge Scheme draft 2.doc to only slash three of the ex's tires* Ty going through a lot right now and this made me smile. Have you seen Lord's and Ladles on Netflix? It's not a competition, but the scenery and the little facts are super interesting. I can be hard on KAT at times but boy am I glad he signed here for 5 more years Kayaking on a hot summer's day with just enough of a breeze to rock you with the waves. I can almost fall asleep out there. ",joy
3228,St. Anger and All Nightmare Long are my favorite albums :)) Your welcome. Hope it all gets better. Hey look It's a Bernout from Potomac! Lol The app trio is the only thing worthwhile there.

I love how the two blonde girls are asleep and with drool. ,joy

My fav time to walk around the city. Everything looks nicer to me. Ugh. ""I've found my forgiveness in [NAME]."" Burn in hell I'm very glad too. She has been with me for twenty years now, so basically all my life. The rams seem pretty happy with [NAME]. ",joy
3230,"Same. It's rare we get rain, might as well enjoy it. I sure did during yesterday's hike. It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use “kicks their trash”. I guess they just don’t want to swear. The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly! Love the place but be ready to wait. They really do take the time to make sure you look good and fresh. ",joy
3231,"The funny/awful part is how well [NAME] works photoshopped in. When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch* Beast milk. My favourite! I watch it every time I see it posted. There's something beautiful about watching someone so passionate and excited about what they've discovered :) This brings a smile to my face Oh man this gave me some flashbacks to awesome times playing with my dad ",joy
3232,"This made me smile. I watched it on YouTube. How about this, you can be the ""bigger man"" and the rest of us will bask in the tears of saints fans.  r/ThirdSentenceHappy My eyes swelled with tears as I opened the door and watched all 8 puppies, overcome with joy, as they were reunited with their Mother. That sounds like a hot date. ;) I've never been, but friends say just order the cheapest food and enjoy the ambiance. ",joy
3233,Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate. All the game modes are super fun good to see your story had a happy ending! I liked the comeback tho The World Between Worlds veered worryingly close to this territory. Luckily it was handled well. I would say ask him. Don't read into things too much. Just enjoy. You'll never know if you don't ask. ,joy
3234,"Aw thank you! Glad you enjoyed it :) Hopefully created a monster. Also, I killed the morning at work. That’s awesome news! Welcome to the family! Ooh! I quite like the swimming pool of makeup as well. That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe. Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now. Glad to see Mrs. [NAME] is still alive and well! ",joy
3235,"Ew yes I’m glad you brought that up. NICE... TO.... MEET YOU... OW! Every time I see this it makes me so happy. She eats it until she throws up the first snows of the year. After that she just likes to play catch with it and roll in it. I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain? The only happy ending I enjoyed on this sub. Good job. ",joy
3236,"I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. 🤣 Found my flair. My wife enjoys marking me. We just make sure they are below the collar line. I'm just gonna hit ""back"" now. See you guys. You’re welcome 😊 Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty.. This just made my day! Thanks for the laugh!! I just ate my last teva those are my favorite ",joy
3237,"If you enjoyed it, go for it. So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly So far, so good That's just the adrenaline. It'll set in soon, haha I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked. Our games against San Fran always seem to have amazing finishes Everytime I wore white pants! Finally got an ablation after kids, best procedure I've ever had besides lasik. ",joy
3238,"1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good Glad your nights going well guys Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back. Just smile and wave boys. Smile and wave. Lmfao. Omg I’m dead. Please do more of these somehow Personally, I think WebOS was the best until HP beat it to death. I loved my Palm Pre. You bet, sweetie ;) But I date girls so don't get too excited <3 ",joy
3239,"Nah man you need to have NEGATIVE IQ to enjoy that show, cuz the weed ain't working. Cheers dude. Upvoted! They are. Primates (humans being the exception) dont hug like that when they're happy.

3241,"[NAME], he’s who I’m most excited to see develop  Very happy with this ! What is the point of this app? Not much is given on their page on the app store other than ""fun"" Bit of a clickbait title. He said it's normal for a big club to sack a manager that's lost a lot of points. It's like muricans don't want to protect their own jobs and are happy to become low-wage dump and burn workers for the owning class. ",joy
3242,"This is wonderful. Hope to have him and that newly a Dad joy back on ice as soon as he's ready. Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I’m one and it’s really fun :) Haha, no. But probably just because I hadn't thought to do it. Happy new year! That was fun I look cuter in red P’s.

Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from 😂😂 ",joy
3245,"All of troomtroom videos on YouTube are this odd and unnecessary. Some even more so. And their thumbnails are interesting > we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip. I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need This just gave me strength :) I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny ",joy

3286,"Most likely shock that had him so comatose. Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap.  What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!! Damn this is experience talking. It kind of surprised us how much of a feeling of control it gave us. ",surprise
3287,"This is way too far down. Probably the quickest 3 hour movie I’ve ever seen. Totally engrossing. That's really interesting. How come? Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018. Damn it even comes with changeable speedshanks ",surprise
3288,"Wow, what a controversial opinion. Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that. Oh I'm not denying he is a scumbag who should be run out of town. Just whether this individual thing happened. sometimes i look up at the stars and i wonder if [NAME] is masterbating to our conversation somewhere out there ",surprise
3289,"Whoa, settle down big texter!!!! Not even sure how that happened? I'm excited as a Lions fan. Wow. Did u say yes? Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them.. I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME]. ",surprise
3290,"Oh no! OMG this sub is gonna be my saving grace for the rest of the year. Thank you so much!! Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH.

Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it Could be depression with psychotic features. Talk to your doctor asap! ",surprise
3295,Can't believe he took the time to count that. They both seem a bit obssesed. What a save! He was in a state of shock lol Damn... I’m not surprised though since everything is super close. With 0 traffic. They also have 1 (one) facility that provides 64 percent of their capacity. Mitigate risk much? That's what I was wondering too. ,surprise
3296,"Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a 'mixup'. And I though Glory Kills were gruesome This is a great idea.

3297,How? They don't have SoundCloud or anything and it's usually played before you're killed. lol Holy shit. Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg. It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol. Beak makes no sense. Well beaks make no sense anyway but this one especially ,surprise
3298,"Holy shit that was fucking bad... What the heck did I just watch Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means. This is a restaurant in a hotel so it had a strange vibe.

Probably more or less amatur x'D Wow. Good thing [NAME] are known for having ample savings since our country treats the average worker so well. I haven't seen a sign like that on mine.

3412,This is the most high school post I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. Ironic if an alt-right nutjob finally makes the alt-right nutjob mods finally mod.

",surprise
3415,"Kinda surprised he listed [NAME] and [NAME] in particular, but not [NAME]. I guess this is the Leafs spotlight working in real time here. You haven’t missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn’t look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that. This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I’m fixin to chew on it for a spell.

3425,You're willing to lie about anything to shill for [NAME]. I fully expect the curse to hit with him blowing out both acl's while playing video games Really? I was in New York last week and had to stand in the freezing cold to pump gas twice. Wooah :o Didn't know [NAME] had a son xD I wonder if losing their majority in the 2019 locals would shift the Unionist parties’ position? ,surprise

I'm surprised they play the national anthem at derby bouts there, been to many bouts in Minnesota and haven't once heard the national anthem performed. ",surprise
3434,Shocking isn’t it really thought he'd hit a bird for the longest time. It's no surprise that the fat and ugly trolls with despicable personalities are the ones against nuclear families.

3439,"Wait what? I don’t get it?? Help. Haha...what kind of fan base would do that? Wow, what a find. The store actually began clapping I think Judge came in a little too late so he’ll need to be amazing for the next 8 years Landslide.

3443,"Oh look, this entire account was made to link to a store that sells this mug. It was my impression that Monzo doesn't offer business bank accounts? I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.

Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison. ,surprise
3446,"I was thinking the same thing. It does make me wonder how whomever leaked it, obtained a copy in the first place.  The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was. It’s bad law. I wouldn’t be surprised either. Wow. That is shockingly uncool. I didnt even recognize [NAME]!!! I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party ",surprise
3447,"This is the first I’m hearing of this. Not on any of the local news, but on Reddit! MASSIVE media bias. Woah. This is a whole new fascinating Reddit thing that I never knew about I wondered what'd happen if I was away for too long from camp. So cool this happens Damn.

Wow fuk I'm watching that right now That 2nd goal was all [NAME]. What a move, and against the best team in the league! What? No angelic BROWN EFFIN COW???? Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/ ",surprise
3454,Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet. I wonder if the school closures with MLK holiday reduce the priority to plow ...

Like I thought they died off around 2014. Ha amazing I thought I was alone ",surprise

That season 2 opener was great and completely unexpected. oh my [NAME] easily one of the worst sounds aaahhhhhh Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails? ",surprise
3467,"Ahhhh BURN 🔥 Whenever a new guy apologises for taking a while to back i just tell him it takes longer if he hits something, so no worries.

My first comment here (I think) is met with hate! Ouch! I drove off 170 onto 40 and was surprised by the lack of brakelights.... keep it closed haha ",surprise
3470,Wow. I dig that. Massive overlap. I have been vegan for 10 years and anti birth around the same time for the reasons you note. That way you’ll get both food and laxative all in one. Sounds like a fair trade to me. How is this long AF? It's like 20 seconds reading. Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed?

Looking forward to some new faces this time. Special surprise for the winner! ",surprise
3473,"That literally doesn’t even look like her omg Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.

Did he ever once state that he likes beer? amendments are allowed on monday to mays deal, i'd be amazed if no one kills her deal ",surprise
